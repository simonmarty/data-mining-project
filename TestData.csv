65 PERCENT OF U.S. ADULTS SAY DONALD TRUMP WAS TOO SLOW TO RESPOND TO COVID-19 OUTBREAK: POLL,"As the novel coronavirus continues to produce some of its most unrelenting damage across the country, Americans indicate that they largely believe President Donald Trump can and should have acted sooner to mitigate the crisis.
According to a survey released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, 65 percent of U.S. adults believe that the president was too slow to take major steps to address the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Americans under the age of 50 were 20 percentage points more likely to say so.
Seventy-three percent of U.S. adults say the worst is yet to come.
The survey was conducted last week, when between 1,500 and 2,000 Americans were dying each day from COVID-19.
Trump has defended his administration's response during the critical month of February, when many reports indicated that the government missed a window to take aggressive, pre-emptive action.
""How do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world when on January 17 you have no cases and no death?"" the president said at a press conference Monday. ""We're supposed to close down the country?""
Trump has further suggested that any sweeping actions he might have taken earlier on would have been opposed by the public at the time. As an example, he said that ""every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I"" implemented travel restrictions on visitors from China at the end of January.
But critics say inaction extends well beyond February, citing his administration's more recent reluctance to use the full measure of the Defense Production Act to compel production of medical equipment in short supply. While the Trump administration has invoked the law in limited fashion, officials have also suggested they believe it is a more powerful tool when used as leverage. Trump has previously derided the law, saying at a press conference in late March that ""we're a country not based on nationalizing our business"" and making a comparison to Venezuela.
Overall, a majority of the public do think it is acceptable for elected officials to criticize the Trump administration's response. Americans across party lines, however, differ in the degree to which they approve. While 85 percent of Democrats think it should be acceptable for elected officials to criticize how the Trump administration is handling COVID-19, Republicans are almost evenly divided, with a slight majority shunning the idea.
Fifty-seven percent of U.S. adults now believe Trump is doing a poor or fair job of providing accurate information about the outbreak. A little more than half of Americans believe that he is making the situation appear better than it really is. Similar percentages believe the same about his meeting the needs of hospitals and working with state governors. On all of these questions, Democrats and Republicans remain deeply polarized.
The Pew survey was conducted from April 7 to April 12 and has an overall margin of error of 2.1 percentage points.",politicsNews,4/18/2020,Newsweek
"NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO ANNOUNCES 540 NEW COVID-19 DEATHS, SAYS FEDS SENT 1.5M CLOTH MASKS TO STATE","New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state had 540 deaths Friday, as New York continues moves past plateau at the apex of the coronavirus pandemic. It raises the total number of deaths in the state at 13,362.
""The worst news is still tragic news. Number of deaths – 540. It's not as high as it was. Still 540 people died yesterday, 540 people, 540 families,"" Cuomo said at his daily coronavirus press conference Saturday.
As Cuomo shifted to the topic of reopening the New York economy, he said that testing is the key to monitoring and controlling the rate of infection.
The infection rate in the state is one person infecting 0.9 people, which is a stable rate of infection. That is down from one person infecting to 1.4 people at the start of the pandemic. Cuomo said the reason for the drop was the implementation of PAUSE, or Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone, which shut down businesses deemed non-essential among other measures aimed at lowering the spread of the novel coronavirus, as well as social distancing and mask use in public.
""The tension on reopening is how fast can you reopen and what can you reopen without raising that infection rate so you go right back to where we were overwhelming the hospitals,"" Cuomo said.
The governor stated that testing would make it easier to keep the rate of infection down by finding those infected and tracing back through the people who have tested positive to find who they came into contact with.
Cuomo said the main problem he is hearing from New York labs testing for COVID-19 is that they do not have enough reagents, the chemicals applied to swab samples taken from people to determine whether or not they have the novel coronavirus. The reagents, which are different among the different private manufacturers who produce the tests, are in short supply because they either can't get them from overseas or because the federal government is determine where the reagents are sent.
""We need two things from the federal government. We need help on that supply chain, especially when it becomes international, and we need coordination and basic partnership,"" Cuomo said, adding that also needs federal funding in order to reopen. The National Governors Association has asked for $500 billion to aid states.

The federal government sent New York 1.5 million cloth masks for public distribution, as Cuomo's executive order that all New Yorkers wear masks in public went into effect Friday night.
The state saw a net change of minus 349 hospitalizations for Friday. However, there were still 1,915 new hospitalizations for the day.
""If you look at the past three days [of hospitalizations] you could argue that we are past the plateau and we're starting to descend, which would be very good news. Again, it's only three days, but that's what the numbers would start to suggest,"" Cuomo said.
""We still have about 2,000 people yesterday who were new admissions to a hospital...That is still an overwhelming number every day.""
""If it wasn't for the relative context that we've been in this would be devastating news, 2,000 people coming into the hospital system...This is where we were in late-March when it started to go up. So, we're not at the plateau anymore, but we're still not in a good position,"" the governor said.
Cuomo told New Yorkers in March that the state would need 140,000 beds in order to deal with this pandemic, but the most hospitalizations New York has seen was 18,825 on April 12. The current number of hospitalizations is 16,967, according to Cuomo.
The United States Navy Ship Comfort, which was sent to New York on President Donald Trump's authorization after Cuomo asked for more hospital beds, remains largely empty. There are currently 71 COVID-19 patients on the ship, according to a report by CNBC. The ship has a capacity of 500 beds for patients infected with the disease.
Mayor Bill de Blasio released a video on Twitter Saturday thanking residents for practicing social distancing and to report when they see fellow New Yorkers disobeying state guidelines: ""How do you report places that aren't enforcing social distancing? It's simple: just snap a photo and text it to 311-692.""
""Sending that photo in is going to help make sure that people are kept apart and that's going to stop the disease from spreading and that's going to save live,"" the mayor said.
Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, which has the second most cases in the country, announced Saturday that the state has 81,420 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 4,070 deaths.
Murphy urged residents to continue to follow state stay-at-home orders so that the numbers do not rise, as health officials in the state said they have flattened the curve.
As of Saturday afternoon, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States is over 711,000, and more than 37,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tracker.",politicsNews,4/18/2020,Newsweek
HOUSE DEMOCRATS' CAMPAIGN ARM RAISED A RECORD $43 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER,"The fundraising arm that works to get House Democrats elected raked in $43.5 million in the first quarter of this year—the group's highest-ever single quarter, the committee's chairwoman told Newsweek on Monday.
With more than $80 million cash on hand—$28 million more than this point during the 2018 election cycle—Democrats have positioned themselves exceptionally well for this November to defend the dozens of House seats they flipped two years ago and to retain control of the chamber.
""Freshmen Democrats will have the resources to get the jobs done,"" Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), told Newsweek in an interview. ""They're running against people who have a very poor showing right now.""
Ahead of their filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) by end of day Monday, Bustos said this March's $14.3 million intake was also record-breaking compared to all past ones, bringing the total raised during this election cycle to $168 million. At this time in 2018, the DCCC had raised $139 million—$29 million less.
The committee fundraising haul is on top of the party's most vulnerable House members, many of whom are first-term lawmakers who represent districts won by President Donald Trump, dominating their Republican challengers in fundraising the first quarter.
On average, the nearly four dozen most at-risk House Democrats brought in three times the amount of money and have more than five times the amount of cash in the bank than their Republican rivals. The average swing-district Democrat brought in $685,000 and has more than $2.3 million in the bank. In comparison, each GOP campaign brought in about $212,000 per candidate and has an average of less than $434,000 on hand.
""I look at this through a different lens, in that all of the work we did up through March and going into quarter two we will need to be successful in November in a very, very new campaign normal,"" Bustos said.
The first-quarter DCCC numbers are likely to mark another month—and quarter—in which the group outraises its GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). As of Monday, the NRCC had yet to submit its numbers to the FEC and did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment.
Before March, the DCCC outraised the NRCC each quarter during the 2020 election cycle, along with 13 out of 14 months. In 2019, the DCCC raised $40 million more than the NRCC. And at the end of February, the DCCC had nearly $27.5 million more cash on hand than the NRCC.
In an effort to relay a sense of urgency to GOP candidates, the chairman of the NRCC, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), has warned Republicans about the fundraising shortfalls.
""Our members need to get their act together and raise more money. The individual campaigns need to raise more money,"" Emmer told the conservative Ripon Society in January. ""They cannot expect somebody else is gonna do it for them. That's the one issue I think we're gonna have over the next quarter, is getting these guys moving.""
Democrats' strong fundraising numbers also comes as the coronavirus pandemic has forced campaigns to cease normal operations and officials to postpone primary elections. The health crisis has the potential to transform the way America conducts its elections, giving incumbents a leg-up on the competition as donations are expected to dwindle amid congressional campaigns making less asks for contributions.
Despite this, Bustos said online fundraising remained ""excellent"" through quarter two and surpassed the DCCC's projections, including the latter half of March when social distancing guidelines forced much of the U.S. economy to suddenly shudder. Bustos chalked-up part of Democrats' success due to how members have structured their campaigns ""in a way to help people.""
She argued that constituents have rewarded Democrats for using their campaigns to perform wellness checks on at-risk community members and to pass along advice from medical professionals during tele-townhalls.
""I think what people see House Democrats doing, including candidates, is we are removing the politics from politicking during this worldwide pandemic,"" Bustos said.
Examples of strong individual first quarters include Democrats Katie Porter and Josh Harder of California, who boast more than 30 times the amount of campaign cash as their challengers. In Michigan and Virginia, Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Abigail Spanberger have more than $3 million in the bank compared to their opponents' less than $500,000, respectively. Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey has nearly $8 million compared to his GOP rival's roughly $560,000.
The DCCC will use much of its money to invest in building new software to more effectively and efficiently reach grassroots voters as campaigns face the ongoing reality of social distancing, according to Bustos. The committee will also put resources toward voting by mail, a measure of casting ballots that Democrats in Congress want the federal government to inject billions of dollars into ahead of the Fall elections.
""It's almost like starting from scratch because we have to do things so much differently than we have before,"" she said.",politicsNews,4/20/2020,Newsweek
"MAJORITY OF DEMOCRAT VOTERS UNDER 30 DON'T THINK PARTY WILL UNITE BEHIND JOE BIDEN, POLL SHOWS","The majority of young Democratic voters under the age of 30 are unconvinced the party will unite to support presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a new Pew Research Center poll shows.
The poll, published last week, surveyed registered Democrats during the second week of April and found 63 percent of respondents said they expected the party to support Biden in the general election. However, 59 percent of young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 were less certain Biden could bring the party together after a contentious primary election season. Biden has so far earned endorsements from most of his primary competitors, the latest of which came last week as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth called on their supporters to rally behind Biden.
""I am asking all Americans—I'm asking every Democrat, I'm asking every Independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans—to come together in this campaign to support [Biden's] candidacy, which I endorse,"" Sanders told Biden. Sanders, who was the final Democrat to suspend his campaign, attracted significant support from younger voters with his Medicare for All plan and support for the Green New Deal, among other key issues.
Other age groups polled are more optimistic in Biden's ability to unite the party by November. More than 70 percent of Democratic voters ages 50 and older believed the party would support Biden, while 58 percent of those between the ages of 30 and 49 said they shared that view.
The poll also showed that 47 percent of registered voters said they would vote for Biden if the election were to be held now, while 45 percent said they would support President Donald Trump. Despite their reported uncertainty about Biden, more young voters said they still supported him over Trump. Although 16 percent of voters under 30 said they supported neither candidate, Pew's poll showed, Biden pulled 53 percent of those voters, compared with the 30 percent of them who said they support Trump.
In addition to garnering endorsements from Sanders and Warren, Biden also earned an official endorsement from former President Barack Obama last week. Obama remains popular among Democratic voters and could be key in attracting the support of young voters for Biden in the months to come.
""Choosing Joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a close friend,"" Obama said in his endorsement. ""I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now.""",politicsNews,4/20/2020,Newsweek
ELIZABETH WARREN ENDORSES JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT,"Elizabeth Warren has officially endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden.
The Massachusetts senator made the announcement in a Twitter video released Wednesday morning. Her endorsement comes one day after former President Barack Obama threw his support behind his former vice president.
""Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with empathy, competence and heart will save lives and livelihoods. And we can't afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American. That's why I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden as president of the United States,"" Warren said in the clip.
Warren's endorsement could be key in helping Biden court younger, more progressive voters. Her policies, such as single-payer health care and canceling student debt, placed her to the left of most other Democratic primary candidates. Most millennial and Generation Z voters in the Democratic primary race supported either her or Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden touted Warren's announcement on Twitter, writing: ""We are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I'm proud to have the fiercest of fighters, Senator@EWarren, on my side. With her help, we're going to beat Donald Trump and create a government that works for everyone—not just the wealthy and well-connected. Let's do this.""
Warren ended her presidential campaign in March after failing to win in most of the early voting states. After her exit, the Massachusetts senator said she would not immediately be endorsing a candidate.
""I think I would have made a better president than either one of them, that's why I was running,"" Warren said in an interview with The Boston Globe. ""I thought it was worth fighting for another approach.""
Biden has already made an effort to court Warren's devoted voter base since her departure from the primary race. The former vice president endorsed the senator's bankruptcy reform plan last month, putting an end to a years-long battle between the two lawmakers on the issue.
""I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal, which in fact goes further, allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy, provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us to in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances,"" Biden said. ""So there's a whole range of things we agree on.""
Warren has been floated as a possible pick for vice president after Biden pledged during the last Democratic debate to have a female running mate if selected as the party's nominee. Warren told The View that she was ""really was heartened to see the vice president say, 'It's time to have a woman at least somewhat close to the White House.'""
Warren is one of the last primary contenders to throw her support behind the former vice president.
Biden had quickly consolidated support from his former opponents and used it to his advantage. Endorsements from Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Representative Beto O'Rourke helped lead him to an electoral sweep on Super Tuesday. Other former candidates, such as Senator Kamala Harris and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have also endorsed him.
Even Sanders, whose exit from the race in early April essentially handed Biden the nomination, was quick to endorse the former vice president.
""It's no secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences,"" Sanders said during a live stream address on Monday. ""But I hope that these task forces will come together, using the best minds and people in your campaign and my campaign to work out real solutions to these very, very important problems.""
Warren's endorsement echoed that of Sanders in her pledge for unity and working together not only to defeat Trump but to help ""rebuild and transform our country"" after he's out of office.
""Among all the other candidates I competed with in the Democratic primary, there's no one I've agreed with 100 percent of the time over the years. But one thing I appreciate about Joe Biden is he will always tell you where he stands,"" the senator said, adding that he's not ""too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.""

"BERNIE SANDERS ASKS SUPPORTERS TO DONATE TO DEMOCRATIC PARTY, 'SHOW COMMITMENT TO PARTY UNITY'","Senator Bernie Sanders sent his supporters an email Friday urging them donate to the Democratic National Committee (DNC).
Sanders endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday after dropping out of the race for president the previous week. The independent senator who twice sought the Democratic nomination asked supporters to donate to the DNC in the name of ""party unity.""
""My campaign for president may be over, but our struggle continues,"" the email says. ""That struggle begins with defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history, but it does not end there.""
""I will also be doing everything in my power to elect strong progressives at every level of government,"" it continues. ""Make a $7 contribution to the Democratic Unity Fund today to show your commitment to party unity by helping elect Democrats nationwide.""
Former President Barack Obama, who endorsed Biden Tuesday, announced the creation of the Democratic Unity Fund in May 2019, saying it was intended to bring the party together behind the eventual Democratic nominee.
""I'm excited that the DNC asked me to announce a bold new effort: The Democratic Unity Fund,"" Obama said in an email at the time. ""The Democratic Unity Fund is a promise that whoever earns our nomination, he or she will have a strong, united, and well-organized DNC ready to spring into action the moment the general election starts.""
Despite the endorsement, a number of Sanders supporters have expressed resistance to the idea of supporting the former vice president in the upcoming election, insisting that too many of the policy positions offered by Sanders are absent in Biden's platform. Former Sanders campaign Press Secretary Briahna Joy Gray made it clear she was not endorsing Biden shortly after Sanders made his endorsement.
""With the utmost respect for Bernie Sanders, who is an incredible human being & a genuine inspiration, I don't endorse Joe Biden,"" Gray tweeted on Monday. ""I supported Bernie Sanders because he backed ideas like #MedicareForAll, cancelling ALL student debt, & a wealth tax. Biden supports none of those.""
Sanders noted that Gray was no longer ""on the payroll"" during a Tuesday interview with the Associated Press. He also urged his supporters to support his former rival regardless of any differences, insisting that defeating President Donald Trump is more important.
""I believe that it's irresponsible for anybody to say, 'Well, I disagree with Joe Biden—I disagree with Joe Biden!—and therefore I'm not going to be involved,'"" Sanders said during the interview.
Some supporters of Sanders have also been reluctant to get behind Biden due to an allegation that he sexually assaulted his former Senate aide Tara Reade in 1993. Biden and his campaign have denied the allegation, saying that the incident ""absolutely did not happen.""
Newsweek reached out to Sanders for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.",politicsNews,4/17/2020,Newsweek
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL INCLUDES TAX BENEFIT FOR MILLIONAIRES THAT WILL COST TAXPAYERS $90 BILLION,"Tucked away in the historic $2.2 trillion relief package passed by Congress last month is a tax change that overwhelmingly benefits millionaires.
More than 80 percent of the benefits from the new provision will go to Americans earning more than $1 million annually, according to a report released last week by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Less than 3 percent of the benefits from the change will go to people earning less than $100,000 a year.
The change is estimated to cost taxpayers about $90 billion in 2020 and will add roughly $170 billion to the federal deficit over the next decade, the congressional committee's report found.
""It's a scandal for Republicans to loot American taxpayers in the midst of an economic and human tragedy,"" Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said in a statement after the report was released.
Thornton Matheson, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said the tax change was ""a very bad use of the money"" provided by the relief package. The measure is the second-largest tax cut in the legislation.
""I don't think that is a good measure in the sense that it's not focused on the people who are most severely affected by this crisis. Surely, the wealthy partnership owners will be affected but not to the extent of low-income households,"" Matheson told Newsweek. She added that the tax break is going to ""provide little stimulus to the economy.""
The Joint Committee on Taxation completed the report at the request of Whitehouse and Representative Lloyd Doggett. A Democrat from Texas, Doggett noted that the tax change is more than the new funding provided for hospitals and for state governments by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
""Someone wrongly seized on this health emergency to reward ultrarich beneficiaries, likely including the Trump family, with a tax loophole not available to middle-class families,"" Doggett said in a statement. ""This net operating loss loophole is a loser that should be repealed.""
The tax break is a reversal of restrictions imposed by GOP lawmakers in the 2017 tax law. The change will suspend a limitation on how much certain business owners can deduct against their nonbusiness income. Now, business owners can lower their taxes by deducting as much as they want against income unrelated to the company.
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that 43,000 people making more than $1 million would owe roughly $70 billion less in taxes this year because of the suspension.
As Democrats criticize the tax change for being too broad and for benefiting high earners, Republicans have highlighted the fact that these lawmakers still supported the CARES Act. All Senate Democrats voted for the legislation, which was passed by unanimous consent on March 27.
Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, wrote in an op-ed for Fox News that Democrats are simply trying to score ""political points"" by condemning the tax change.
""This partisan attack threatens the relief intended for businesses in every industry across America. The attempt to paint this tax provision as a boon for real estate and hedge fund investors completely misses the mark,"" Grassley wrote. ""Notably, the CARES Act did not change the longstanding limits on investors being able to benefit from passive investment losses.""",politicsNews,4/20/2020,Newsweek
MICHIGAN GOVERNOR WHITMER SAYS STAY AT HOME ORDER 'ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY' AS STATE FACES 'DISPROPORTIONATE THREAT',"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer defended her stay at home order amid criticism on Sunday, telling a local TV station that it was ""absolutely necessary"" given the ""disproportionate threat"" of COVID-19 infections in the state.
Speaking to WXYZ 7 Action News in Detroit, Whitmer said Michigan faced a ""unique problem"" being the tenth largest state in the country while having the third highest number of confirmed coronavirus deaths.
The Democratic governor also said she wanted to avoid having to issue a second stay at home order ""at all costs"" once the first order is lifted.
Appearing on 7 Action News, Gov. Whitmer said: ""I think the order was absolutely necessary... having the third most deaths in the country when we are the tenth largest state shows we've got a unique problem in Michigan.
""We have to have unique solutions, and they've got to be driven by the best science and what's in the best interest of the health of the people. It won't do any good if we don't take this seriously and just jump right back into life as it was and have another stay at home order later in the year.""
Whitmer added that she was trying to avoid that outcome ""at all costs,"" and said there was ""no one"" more interested in getting the economy back up-and-running than her.
""But the fact of the matter is, it's really critical that we do it in a smart way so that it's safe for the workers and the customers alike,"" she added.
Asked for her reaction to President Donald Trump's criticism of some of her social distancing measures, Gov. Whitmer said: ""It's fine. I think part of the issue that we're confronting as a state though is that we have a unique challenge.""
After noting the number of cases in the state, she added: ""We have a disproportionate threat here in Michigan, and it calls for stronger policies than any other state in the nation because we've got a tougher problem to solve.""
Whitmer went on to recognize that sacrifices being made were ""tough"" for both individuals and small businesses amid the pandemic.
""I also know that if we don't take these aggressive actions, COVID-19 threatens our whole healthcare system,"" the governor said. ""It threatens to take away more lives. It makes it harder for us to rebound from this economically.""
Gov. Whitmer's stay at home order has faced backlash from some local residents who feel its restrictions go too far.",politicsNews,4/20/2020,Newsweek
DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE IS UNAWARE OF SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER'S STOCK TRADES AFTER ECONOMIC TASK FORCE APPOINTMENT,"President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday that he was not aware of controversy around Sen. Kelly Loeffler's (R-GA) stock trades before the coronavirus pandemic hit markets.
The commander-in-chief said he didn't know about the congresswoman's stock sales after the decision to include her on an economic task force was questioned at his latest coronavirus briefing.
President Trump created a bipartisan panel tasked with planning the reopening of the U.S. economy last week as part of his efforts to curb the economic damage caused by pandemic-related shutdowns.
The White House released a statement on Thursday naming the 65 senators and 32 representatives on the ""Opening Up America Again"" congressional group.
""Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we're calling, 'Opening Up America Again,'"" President Trump said at the time. ""And that's what we're doing: We're opening up our country. And we have to do that. America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open.""
A reporter asked President Trump on Sunday why he included Sen. Kelly Loeffler on the task force in light of her stock sales just weeks before markets were rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""That I don't know. I really don't know about that,"" Trump said. ""She's a senator from Georgia and she was included in the list, absolutely.""
The Daily Beast reported last month that Sen. Loeffler sold off thousands of dollars worth of stock after a private congressional briefing on the coronavirus in January. The price of shares in some of those firms would later decline as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Earlier this month, the Atlanta-Journal Constitution also noted that the congresswoman sold further stocks over February and March, according to financial disclosure data.
Sen. Loeffler has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and told Tucker Carlson last month that her stock portfolio managers handled trades before telling her anything.",politicsNews,4/20/2020,Newsweek
"TEENAGER WHO SHARED CORONAVIRUS INFECTION ON INSTAGRAM THREATENED WITH ARREST BY POLICE, LAWSUIT SAYS","A lawsuit filed Thursday said a patrol sergeant following a sheriff's orders violated a Wisconsin teenager's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by telling her to remove an Instagram post, in which she said she was suffering from COVID-19 symptoms.
The patrol sergeant said he would ""start taking people to jail"" if the post was not deleted, according to the complaint.
Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL) filed the lawsuit with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on behalf of the teenager, identified in the complaint as a student at Westfield Area High School in Marquette County. Patrol Sergeant Cameron Klump and Sheriff Joseph Konrath of the Marquette County Sheriff's Department were both listed as defendants.
""The First Amendment's protection of speech, especially online speech, is as vital as ever during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" the complaint said. ""This case is about preserving the right to share our experiences with each other during this difficult time.""
The law firm said the teenager began experiencing respiratory symptoms common among COVID-19 patients after a trip to Florida with her classmates in March. The teenager and her classmates returned home as the coronavirus pandemic began forcing states across the country to shut down. The complaint said she then developed a fever and cough within five days of arriving back home on March 15.
The teenager's parents tried to contact their daughter's teacher to alert other students of her possible COVID-19 symptoms, but their attempts were unsuccessful, the complaint said. In the days that followed, she was briefly hospitalized for her symptoms but ultimately tested negative for the virus, the law firm said.
Doctors told the teenager and her parents that ""in their opinion"" she ""likely had COVID-19, but had missed the window for testing positive,"" WILL wrote in an April 3 letter to Konrath. The letter went on to say that the family ""believed and still believe the doctors' diagnosis.""
The teenager returned home after receiving her negative results and posted an update on Instagram that read, ""I am finally home after being hospitalized for a day and a half. I am still om [sic] breathing treatment but have beaten the corona virus [sic]. Stay home and be safe.""
According to the complaint, Klump arrived at the family's home on March 27 and told the teenager's parents Konrath had received a complaint from her school about the post. Klump said he had direct orders from Konrath to ""demand"" that she ""delete this post,"" and if she did not, to cite the teen and/or her parents for ""disorderly conduct,"" the complaint said.
Klump said Konrath wanted the post deleted because no cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in the county at that time, the complaint said. Marquette County confirmed its first COVID-19 cases three days later.
Deputy Counsel Luke Berg, who represents the family, told Newsweek the firm was pursuing a records request with the school to determine who had filed the alleged complaint with the sheriff's department.
""It struck me as a flagrant First Amendment violation,"" he said of the incident. ""The thought that law enforcement would be patrolling social media is terrifying, quite frankly.""
Konrath did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment by publication time.",politicsNews,4/17/2020,Newsweek
HOW DONALD TRUMP COULD REWARD GOVERNORS WHO OPEN THEIR ECONOMIES EARLY—OR PUNISH THOSE WHO DON'T,"Although the Trump administration placed responsibility for lifting social distancing measures and restarting the U.S. economy on the shoulders of the nation's governors, he still has tools to persuade them to move at the pace he wants them to, experts said.
The big one? Money.
The president's control of federal funds is the ""major knife"" he could use to entice or intimidate governors into lifting quarantine measures early, said Paul Rosenzweig, a former deputy assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Additional federal assistance could fatten cash-strapped state budgets strained further by battling the coronavirus outbreak as a kind of reward for getting the economy rolling again, Rosenzweig, now a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, said.
But money, he added, is only one way to ""skin the cat.""
Trump could also offer—or withhold—federal assistance like personnel, equipment, or access to federal expertise to states that don't move fast enough for his liking.
""You can mix and match them any way you want,"" he said.
As for how Trump could withhold the same assistance from states that don't move quickly enough for his liking, Rosenzweig said the White House could craft rules for future coronavirus aid programs that require states to open back up to receive aid ""on the theory that they need it more to achieve what they want to do.""
However, the amount of money over which federal agencies have unfettered discretion is ""relatively small,"" so using that tactic may not have much impact, University of Virginia Miller Center fellow Chris Lu, who served as White House cabinet secretary and as deputy labor secretary under the Obama administration, told Newsweek. That's because most federal funds distributed to states are allocated by a population-based formula.
""Even if there is that kind of money available, it's such small dollars that I don't think it meaningfully makes an impact,"" he said.
The amounts being appropriated in the COVID-19 relief bills that Congress has passed so far, such as the recently passed CARES Act, are also much larger than what states could get from existing grant programs overseen by the executive branch, Lu added.
But given Trump's history of trying to weaponize federal funds, Lu said he would not be surprised to see the administration explore using federal funds to incentivize states to reopen their economies.
""With this president, nothing is ever out of the question, but it would be legally indefensible.""
One local official whose state could be on the receiving end of Trump's wrath, Highland Park, Illinois Mayor Nancy Rotering, told Newsweek that Trump's ""mercurial nature"" has led her and other officials in her situation to plan for such eventualities.
""At this point, we've almost gotten to the point where we expect that kind of behavior and we'll do what we need to do to protect our own residents regardless,"" she said. ""The issue with hearing that supplies had been stymied in their delivery to states who weren't sufficiently appreciative is is an appalling reality that tells us how we need to move forward in the situation. To me, it's a matter of doing what's right, and unfortunately, we are not able to depend on the federal government.""
Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin drew parallels to Trump's behavior over the spring and summer of 2019, when he ordered $391 million in military aid to Ukraine withheld to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
""The President's basic M.O. is to engage in bluster and threat, and then to try to use coercive leverage to get people to do his daily will, so we can expect that he will try to use the resources of the federal government to have his way with the various governors,"" said Raskin, a second-term Democrat and former constitutional law professor. ""But that's a frivolous president trying to intimidate serious governors who are engaged in public policy work, so there would be a massive and immediate reaction to the president trying to treat governors of the United States the way that he treated President Zelenskiy in Ukraine.""
Rosenzweig also offered an extreme tactic Trump could use: the Stafford Act, which governs federal disaster declarations to cancel existing disaster declarations.
Traditionally, the Stafford Act has not been politicized in that way, he said, adding that doing so could be a ""double-edged sword"" for Trump that could set a bad precedent in the future.
""That would be a bit of a political nightmare for him,"" he said. ""I think it would it would portend a Democratic president refusing aid to a Republican governor.""
He added that such an unprecedented use of presidential authority could be a political bridge too far, even for Trump.
While Rosenzweig said that Congress ""has been relatively weak in its response"" to Trump's prior abuses of federal funds, Raskin said that he and his fellow House Democrats are fully prepared to stop him.
""If he starts to massively manipulate federal funding to coerce a governor, to his political bidding, we will do everything in our power to stop him under the impoundment act. He has no authority to interfere with the flow of federal funds for personal and political reasons,"" he said.",politicsNews,4/17/2020,Newsweek
"TRUMP CALLS PELOSI AN 'INHERENTLY DUMB PERSON,' CRITICIZES FOX NEWS HOST CHRIS WALLACE FOR INTERVIEWING HER","President Donald Trump on Sunday called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi an ""inherently dumb person"" after her appearance on Fox News, and also criticized host Chris Wallace for having her on his show.
Pelosi appeared on Fox News Sunday, for the first time since 2017, to criticize Trump's coronavirus response and refusal to take responsibility for his early remarks downplaying the outbreak.
""Leaders – leaders take responsibility. So I said he's a weak leader. He doesn't take responsibility. He places blame – blame on others,"" the Speaker told Wallace. ""And that might have been OK before, but we cannot continue down a path that is, again I'll come back to science, science, science, evidence, data on how we should go forward.""
Trump took to Twitter to lash out at the Democrat and the network's host after her appearance. ""Nervous Nancy is an inherently 'dumb' person,"" the president tweeted. ""She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax. She will be overthrown, either by inside or out, just like her last time as 'Speaker'. Wallace & Fox News are on a bad path, watch!""
Newsweek reached out to Pelosi's office and Fox News for comment.
Trump has faced mounting criticism over the federal government's inability to adequately ramp up COVID-19 testing, which has made it more difficult for public health officials to accurately track the virus' spread. Pelosi on Sunday said the president ""gets an F"" on testing, and noted that White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci's recommendations on testing ""hasn't been done.""
During the White House COVID-19 news conference on Saturday, the president defended his administration from criticisms over testing and claimed that U.S. testing capacity is ""fully sufficient"" to start the process of reopening the country.
Trump also called out his favorite cable news channel Fox News last Sunday over unfavorable coverage. ""Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe, Chris Wallace, on Fox News. I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press (please!), or the people over at Deface the Nation,"" the president tweeted. ""What the hell is happening to Fox News. It's a whole new ballgame over there!""
The president's remarks last week were not the first time he has publicly criticized Wallace or complained about Democrats being featured on the network. Last month, Trump claimed that Fox News' decision to interview members of the Democratic Party signaled the ""beginning of the end"" for the network. He also attacked Wallace and insisted he should be on ""Fake News CNN or MSDNC.""
Wallace responded to the attacks at the time by saying that such criticism from the president merely indicates that he's doing his job. ""I have been in the business for half a century and I have been attacked by all sides,"" the host said.",politicsNews,4/19/2020,Newsweek
"CUOMO SAYS NEW YORK'S CORONAVIRUS CURVE IS DESCENDING, BUT 'IT'S NO TIME TO GET ARROGANT' ABOUT PROGRESS","New York's new coronavirus figures suggest an ongoing downturn in the outbreak's severity, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday. According to his office's most recent impact report—shared during its latest COVID-19 briefing at Northwell Health's Long Island facility—single-day hospitalization, intubation and fatality counts have decreased statewide since Saturday's update.
""If the data holds and if this trend holds, we are past the high point and all indications, at this point, are that we are on a descent,"" Cuomo noted, referencing New York's overall coronavirus curve. His comment reiterating a similar statement shared to Twitter early Sunday afternoon, in which the governor said New York is ""now descending the other side of the mountain."" In both instances, Cuomo reminded state residents that a continued decline in coronavirus numbers hinges on their ability to adhere to social distancing guidelines.
""It's no time to get cocky, and it's no time to get arrogant,"" he told the press room. ""We're not at the plateau anymore, but we're still not in a good position.""
Cuomo announced that 507 new deaths were reported Saturday, down from 540 on Friday and 630 Thursday. The totals—while extremely consequential—reflect a progressive decrease in daily fatality reports compared to prior statistics. Overall, there have been 242,786 cases of coronavirus throughout the state.
Similarly, New York's daily hospital admission and intubation rates have decreased over the last three days, with almost 800 fewer patients hospitalized on Saturday than there were 48 hours earlier. Cuomo called this ""good news,"" but acknowledged that the state continues to report new hospitalizations in staggering volumes every day. Between Saturday and Sunday's news briefings, the governor said approximately 1,300 coronavirus patients were admitted to hospitals statewide.
In addition to maintaining social distance measures, Cuomo discussed the state's infection management plans moving forward. Starting next week, New York's Department of Health will begin to administer antibody tests to residents across the state. The test aims to determine if an individual has contracted the coronavirus based on the presence of certain antibodies. It is possible that individuals with detectable antibodies may have some immunity to the disease, at least for a period of time. Being that many people could have carried and transmitted the virus without exhibiting symptoms, Cuomo said widespread antibody testing will provide state officials with ""the first true snapshot of what were really dealing with.""
During his own coronavirus news briefing earlier Sunday morning, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also relayed his office's updated approach to addressing the outbreak, which includes the creation of a Unified Victim Identification System for residents to report loved ones who may be missing as a result of COVID-19.
""We are leaving no stone unturned to help New Yorkers in this time of crisis,"" the mayor said in a statement. ""To those who are grieving: we see you, we hear you, and we are here to help.""
More than 2.3 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide as of Sunday morning, according to Johns Hopkins University's tracker. Roughly one-third of those cases were diagnosed in the United States, which has reported a significant higher incidence of infection than any one of the 185 countries touched by the disease and has long been considered the outbreak's global epicenter. New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, California, Michigan and Illinois have experienced the highest diagnosis, hospitalization and death rates nationwide.
As Cuomo discussed during Sunday's coronavirus briefing, states that have been hit hardest by the U.S. outbreak will face significant challenges as the country looks to restore its economic sector in response to the descending outbreak curve. Alongside Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, Cuomo recently introduced a bill to Congress that would provide $500 billion in federal aid directly to states.
""Everyone is saying, 'Well, it's up to the states to come up with a reopening plan. It's up to the governors.' And that's true and right and legal, but the governors in the states have to have resources,"" Cuomo said Sunday, calling on the federal government to prioritize and delegate those resources. ""If you don't help the state government and local government, then how are we supposed to have the finances to reopen?"" he continued.
Referencing pushback from Republican senators that would prevent the White House's next stimulus package—which seeks to bolster loans programs for small businesses, offer additional funding to hospitals and expand testing—from providing any aid to states, de Blasio urged President Donald Trump to intervene in a series of tweets shared Sunday afternoon.
""It's as simple as this: you can step in and fight for your hometown in this next stimulus package or you can turn away and fail to protect New Yorkers,"" he wrote. ""Mr. President, if you don't help New York City — the nation's largest city — back on its feet, you can kiss your economic recovery goodbye.""
New Jersey has reported the second-highest incidence of coronavirus cases and fatalities in the U.S., behind New York. As of Sunday afternoon, the state according to its tracker has confirmed more than 85,300 diagnoses and about 4,200 deaths as a result of the disease. On Thursday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy extended statewide school closures through at least May 15. During his daily coronavirus conference the following day, Murphy said students may need to wear protective masks in classes if they do return to school next month.",politicsNews,4/19/2020,Newsweek
TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE MNUCHIN SAYS PUTTING TRUMP'S NAME ON STIMULUS CHECKS WAS HIS IDEA: 'TERRIFIC SYMBOL',"Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin noted Sunday that it was his idea to put President Donald Trump's name on each of the stimulus relief checks before they head out to millions of mailboxes nationwide.
Appearing on CNN's State of the Union, Mnuchin said he personally came up with the idea as a ""terrific symbol"" to taxpayers amid the coronavirus pandemic. The move was widely criticized as a narcissistic election year stunt. ""Stimulus checks for $1,200 are being mailed out to many Americans, some already got them through direct deposit, but they're being mailed to help Americans through this crisis,"" CNN host Jake Tapper said to Mnuchin. ""For the first time, ever, President Trump's name is going to appear on an IRS check, which is being put in the memo line because the president isn't authorized to sign the checks. Did the president personally suggest this idea?""
""Well, let me just correct you and say the checks have not gone out yet, and the reason why the checks have not gone out, is we're hoping that more people, as I said, will go to IRS.gov. It's much safer to send out direct deposits,"" Mnuchin replied.
""As it relates to the president's name on it, the president could have been authorized to sign the checks. That would have slowed things down,"" the treasury secretary continued. ""We didn't want to do that. We did put the president's name on the check. That was my idea. He is the president and I think it's a terrific symbol to the American public.""
Newsweek reached out to the White House Sunday afternoon for additional remarks.
The treasury secretary said he is expecting a ""big rebound"" in the U.S. economy in the coming months, citing both the slow reopening of businesses and the $2 trillion stimulus relief money being dispensed to individuals and businesses alike.
Mnuchin went on to say members of both political parties in Congress are ""making a lot of progress"" in their efforts to reach a deal on how to funnel money into the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funds earlier this week after shelling out $349 billion, Tapper noted. Democratic lawmakers are seeking more funds aimed at ""underserved, small business, mom-and-pop shops"" versus larger restaurant chains.
The treasury secretary said he believes it will be months -- not years -- before the economy can get back to being in the strong position it was in before the pandemic. A Congressional Budget Office report released Saturday found Congress' relief law will add $1.8 trillion to the federal deficit, and the pandemic could allow unemployment rates to remain high through 2021.
""I think it will be months, I definitely don't think it will be years, "" Mnuchin continued. ""We are going to conquer this virus. We are going to have terrific breakthroughs not just on the testing but on the medical front. There are things that are being developed for vaccines, which will take a little bit longer, but one of the things we heard is people want testing. People will react positively that if they contract this disease in the future, there will be medical treatments available as well.""",politicsNews,4/19/2020,Newsweek
GOP GOVERNOR CRITICIZES TRUMP FOR ENCOURAGING STATE PROTESTS AGAINST STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS: 'IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE',"Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan questioned the logic of President Donald Trump encouraging demonstrations against stringent ""stay-at-home"" and ""shelter-in-place"" orders in several states, noting that the demonstrators were essentially protesting guidelines put forward by the White House's Coronavirus Task Force.
Hogan, a Republican, faced a protest within his own state, as demonstrators drove cars, waved flags and honked their horns through Maryland's capital Annapolis on Saturday. The protesters were calling for Hogan to reopen businesses and the economy, despite guidelines put forward by the Trump administration and a growing number of cases of the coronavirus nationwide.
""I don't think it's helpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the president's own policy,"" the GOP governor said during an interview with CNN's State of the Union Sunday. ""For example, I mentioned earlier, the president's policy says you can't start to reopen under his plan until you have declining numbers for 14 days, which those [other] states [with protests] and my state do not have,"" he explained.
""So then to encourage people to go protest, the plan that you just made recommendations on on Thursday, it just doesn't make any sense,"" Hogan added. ""We're sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations.""
The Republican governor asserted that he can understand the frustration expressed by demonstrators. He said that he and other governors wanted to work toward reopening as soon as is safely possible.
Trump on Friday encouraged right-wing protests against stringent social distancing measures, tweeting: ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA,"" ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"" and then ""LIBERATE VIRGINIA.""
""There are a lot of protests out there and I just think that some of the governors have gotten carried away,"" Trump said later, defending his tweets. ""You know we have a lot of people that don't have to be told to do what they're doing.""
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, pushed back against the protests in her state.
""Michigan right now has the third highest death count in the country, we are the 10th largest state, as you can deduce, this means we have a uniquely hard issue going on here,"" Whitmer told State of the Union Sunday. ""It is disproportionately hurting our state and that is why we need to take a uniquely aggressive action to protect people.""
Washington's Governor Jay Inslee, also a Democrat, strongly criticized Trump in an interview with ABC News' This Week.
""To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law, I can't remember any time in my time in America where we have seen such a thing,"" Inslee said Sunday. ""It is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.""
As of Sunday early afternoon, more than 720,000 people were confirmed to have the coronavirus in the U.S., according to a tracker updated by Johns Hopkins University. Of those, nearly 34,000 have died while close to 65,000 have already recovered.",politicsNews,4/19/2020,Newsweek
"NANCY PELOSI CRITICIZES TRUMP'S EARLY CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE, SAYS PRESIDENT THOUGHT 'IT'S GOING TO MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR'","Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi strongly criticized President Donald Trump and his administration's early response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying that the president believed that the crisis would ""magically"" disappear.
Pelosi, a Democrat who represents California, made the remark during a Sunday morning interview with ABC News' This Week. She outlined how Trump had described the coronavirus as a ""hoax"" and had disregarded the scientific information put forward by health experts as the pandemic began to spread throughout the U.S.
""He failed,"" the Speaker asserted. ""He's failed in the testing and the rest, and [said] 'it's a hoax' and 'it's going to magically disappear.' That's not based on science. This isn't magical. This is scientific,"" she said.
""So I've said if he continues to predicate the action that we take on a false premise, well then we're in further danger,"" Pelosi warned. ""And his earlier delay, and denial, caused deaths.""
As Pelosi explained, Trump previously referred to the coronavirus concerns as a ""new hoax"" from the Democrats, while also claiming that it would ""disappear"" like ""a miracle.""
""It's going to disappear. One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear,"" Trump insisted on February 28. He argued that Democrats were raising alarm about the outbreak to criticize his administration.
Earlier in her interview with This Week, Pelosi also addressed criticism lobbed against her by the president. Trump has tweeted a series of attacks over the past couple days referring to the Speaker as ""weak,"" ""crazy"" and ""away on vacation.""
""Frankly, I don't pay that much attention to the president's tweets against me. As I've said, he's a poor leader. He's always trying to avoid responsibility and assign blame,"" she said.
Speaking to Fox News on Sunday morning as well, Pelosi reiterated her criticism of the president.
""Leaders – leaders take responsibility. So I said he's a weak leader. He doesn't take responsibility. He places blame – blame on others,"" the Speaker said. ""And that might have been OK before, but we cannot continue down a path that is, again I'll come back to science, science, science, evidence, data on how we should go forward.""
Trump has faced significant criticism for his early response to the coronavirus. In addition to suggesting that it would ""disappear,"" the president repeatedly downplayed the serious nature of the virus by comparing it to the common seasonal flu. But scientists have estimated that the coronavirus death rate is at least 10 to 20 times higher.
Furthermore, the federal government has struggled to rapidly ramp up testing for the novel virus, making it difficult for public health officials to accurately track the spread. As governors and other state leaders look to reopen their economies, widespread testing and the ability to trace those who may be infected will be vital to preventing further large-scale outbreaks moving forward.
A survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center, which was published on Thursday, found that 65 percent of respondents believed Trump was too slow to take major steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Among American adults under 50 years old, three-quarters (75 percent) thought the president acted too slowly.
As of Sunday morning, there were more than 722,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus nationwide, according to a tracker updated by Johns Hopkins University. Of those, nearly 34,000 people have died while close to 65,000 have already recovered.

TRUMP'S 3 PHASE PLAN TO REOPEN AMERICA'S ECONOMY EXPLAINED,"President Donald Trump unveiled guidelines for ending lockdowns and stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus pandemic. The three-phased guidelines, called Opening Up America Again, are for state and local authorities to follow when reopening their economies.
Though Trump has previously said that he has the authority to lift state lockdowns, the power to reopen states remains with the governors. The Opening Up America Again plan is a guideline, not an order, and state governors are not required to follow the plan.
Some states are joining forces to decide how they will begin lifting their lockdown. California, Oregon, and Washington have teamed up ""to work together on a shared approach for reopening our economies,"" according to a statement. An East Coast group, made up of Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island, will also work together to develop a reopening plan.
According to an introduction to the guidelines, the plan is ""based on up-to-date data and readiness, mitigates risk of resurgence, protects the most vulnerable,"" and is ""implementable on statewide or county-by-county basis at governors' discretion.""
Before beginning the three-phase process, Trump recommends that the states must meet the following criteria:
A downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses and COVID-19 syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period.
A downward trajectory of documented cases or positive tests as a percent of total tests, within a 14-day period.
Hospitals are treating patients without crisis care and have a robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing.
Once states meet these criteria, Trump recommends that they begin the first stage of lifting the lockdown.
Phase One of the Opening Up America Again Guidelines
When a state enters phase one, according to the guidelines, individuals should continue to social distance when in public, and social settings of more than 10 people should be avoided. Individuals should minimize non-essential travel, and follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines regarding self-isolating following travel.
Vulnerable individuals should continue to stay at home and members of their households should be aware that returning to work where distancing isn't practical risks passing on the coronavirus to the vulnerable person.
The guidelines define vulnerable people as ""elderly individuals, individuals with serious underlying health conditions, including high blood pressure, chronic lung disease, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and those whose immune system is compromised such as by chemotherapy for cancer and other conditions requiring such therapy.""
Employers should continue to encourage their employees to work remotely, when possible, and return to work in phases. Additionally, employers should close common areas, minimize non-essential travel, and consider special accommodations for vulnerable employees.
During phase one, schools, daycare centers, and camps should remain closed, and visits to senior living homes and hospitals should be prohibited. Large venues, like dine-in restaurants, movie theaters, sports venues can reopen under strict physical distancing protocols.
Gyms can reopen if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols, but bars should remain closed.
Additionally, elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient basis at facilities that adhere to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.
Phase Two of the Opening Up America Again Guidelines
During phase two, vulnerable individuals should continue to stay at home. Individuals should continue to social distance, but social settings of more than 50 should be avoided. Non-essential travel can resume.
Employers should continue to encourage their employees to work remotely, should keep common areas closed, and should continue to consider special accommodations for the vulnerable population.
In phase two, schools, daycare centers, and camps can reopen, and bars can open with reduced standing-room occupancy.
Phase Three of the Opening Up America Again Guidelines
Vulnerable individuals no longer have to stay at home but should practice social distancing and minimize their exposure to social settings where distancing may not be practical. Low-risk populations should minimize their time spent in crowded environments.
Employers can allow their workers to return to work in phase three.
Visits to senior care facilities and hospitals can resume, but those who interact with residents and patients must maintain high standards of hygiene. Large venues, like movie theaters and sports venues, can operate under limited physical distancing protocols. Bars can operate with increased standing room occupancy.
Guidelines to be followed throughout all phases
Continue to wash hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces.
Avoid touching your face.
Sneeze or cough into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow.
Disinfect frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible.
Strongly consider using face coverings while in public, and particularly when using mass transit.
People who feel sick should not go to work or school and should contact and follow the advice of their medical provider.",politicsNews,4/17/2020,Newsweek
WISCONSIN 'FREEDOM RALLY' PLANNED AFTER GOV. TONY EVERS EXTENDS CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN BY EXTRA MONTH,"A rally which could be attended by thousands of people has been organized outside Wisconsin's State Capitol building in protest after Gov. Tony Evers extended the state ""Safer at Home"" order for another month. The protest, led by ReOpen Wisconsin and Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine, is scheduled for April 24, when the original order was due to end, demanding Gov. Evers reopen the state.
According to a Facebook event page, more than 2,200 people said they will be attending the ""Wisconsin Freedom Rally,"" with nearly 10,000 expressing an interest in the event on social media.
""Government mandating sick people to stay home is called quarantine. However, the government mandating healthy citizens to stay home, forcing businesses and churches to close is called tyranny,"" Reopen Wisconsin said in a statement, TMJ 4 reported. ""It is not sustainable to continue this lockdown as the economic and societal consequences will be irreversible.""
Gov. Evers directed the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) to extend Wisconsin's order from April 24 to May 26 in order to help combat the coronavirus outbreak.
""A few weeks ago, we had a pretty grim outlook for what COVID-19 could mean for our state, but because of the efforts of all of you, Safer at Home is working. That said, we aren't out of the woods just yet,"" said Gov. Evers. ""As I've said all along, we are going to rely on the science and public health experts to guide us through this challenge. So, as we extend Safer at Home, I need all of you to continue doing the good work you've been doing so we can keep our families, our neighbors, and our communities safe, and get through this storm together.""
Madison Marie, one of the rally's organizers, said social distancing could still be observed at the protest, but admits it could be difficult.
""People are responsible for their own health, but we ask that they use common sense and if they are sick we ask that they stay home,"" Marie told Newsweek. ""If they feel safer wearing a mask or gloves, they are free to do so.
""If they don't feel comfortable having people stand closer than six feet, it is their job to let that be known. I'm hoping that everyone will be respectful to each other and respect each other's personal wishes.
""I don't feel like there will be enough room for everyone to stand six feet apart though and not all people want to. Some people miss human interaction,"" Marie said.
The decision to extend the order has also been met with outcry with officials and community leaders.
State Sen. Patrick Testin said Gov. Evers' decision was ""misguided."" Sen. Testin said the governor must reconsider in order to ""avoid the destruction"" of tens of thousands of lives.
""Keeping Wisconsin's economy locked down for another 40 days will have serious repercussions for our communities. In recent weeks, nearly 400,000 people have filed for unemployment—that's simply unsustainable,"" Sen. Testin said in a statement. ""The Governor has to understand that just like a body cannot function without a heart, our state can't function without our small businesses, our farms, or the people whose livelihoods depend on them. I would urge the Governor to meet with legislative leadership and members to strike a more effective solution.""
Colby-Abbotsford Police Chief Jason Bauer also wrote a letter to Gov. Evers in which he urged the governor to ""think of COVID-19 as the Devil.""
""We are not supposed to fear the Devil, faith in God should prevail,"" Bauer wrote. ""I do not fear the Devil nor COVID-19. I believe COVID-19 has some politicians scared, resulting in bad decisions.""
Bauer said that ""residents are ready to go back to work"" and that the safer at home order is not necessary anymore in his county due to the low rate of infections. Bauer also said his department has seen a rise in domestic abuse during the lockdown, suggesting extending the order will make ""some problems worse.""
Gov. Evers' office has been contacted about the rally outside the Capitol building.
A small group of people have already staged a protest against the order to close 40 state parks, forests and recreational areas amid the outbreak.
Dozens of people ignored barricades to enter Lapham Peak in Delafield on April 14 demanding the parks be reopened. ""This is insanity. It's gone way too far. We don't live in Nazi Germany,"" demonstrator Terri Bialas told WISN.
Evers said the decision to close spaces was due to ""unprecedented crowds, litter, vandalism"" seen after people flocked to the state parks when the administration fees were waived.
There are 3,875 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wisconsin with 197 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. In total, 54,703 people have recovered from the virus in the U.S.

JEWISH COLORADO GOVERNOR TEARS UP AFTER GOP LEADER COMPARES STAY-AT-HOME ORDER TO NAZISM,"Colorado Gov. Jared Polis choked up as he rebuked a local Republican's suggestion that his stay-at-home order would lead to a ""Gestapo-like mentality"" amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Polis said he was ""offended by any comparison to Nazism"" on Wednesday, noting that he was a Jewish American who lost family in the Holocaust, The Denver Post reported. The Colorado governor became the first Jewish person to be elected to the local post in 2018.
At a press briefing on Wednesday, a reporter asked Gov. Polis: ""I'm seeing a lot of rebellion out here against your orders, which have been called tyrannical... being equated to Nazism. How do you react to that?""
""First of all, as a Jewish American who lost family in the Holocaust, I'm offended by any comparison to Nazism,"" Gov. Polis responded.
As he began to tear up, the governor added: ""We act to save lives, the exact opposite of the slaughter of six million Jews and many gypsies and Catholics, and gays and lesbians, and Russians and so many others.""
Addressing other local frustrations with the stay-at-home order, Polis said: ""We know that these steps are difficult, and it's not a contest to see what you can get away with. It's a contest to see how well you can stay at home.
""By not staying at home, by having parties, by congregating, you're not sticking it to the government. You're not sticking it to Jared Polis. You're sticking it to yourself, because you're putting yourself and your loved ones in jeopardy.""
Gov. Polis issued his rebuke of the comparison between his stay-at-home order and Nazism three weeks after 9 News first reported that the Colorado House Minority Leader, Patrick Neville (R), told The Peter Boyles Show that orders like that could lead to a ""Gestapo-like mentality.""
""That's what we have to rely on, the American spirit and the American people to get us through this, and not these panic orders and these shutdown orders and what's leading to a Gestapo-like mentality,"" Neville said.
Newsweek contacted Patrick Neville's office for comment and will update this article with any response.
The Colorado House Minority Leader reportedly told The Denver Post that he ""should have said authoritarian, not Gestapo,"" but also declined to apologize for his remark.
Gov. Polis issued a statewide stay-at-home order at the end of March along with several other states seeking to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. He later extended the length of the order to April 26.
According to Colorado's official COVID-19 website, the stay-at-home order could be further extended if necessary amid the pandemic.",politicsNews,4/17/2020,Newsweek
DONALD TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WILL OPEN UP BUT SCIENTISTS PREDICT WE'LL BE BACK IN LOCKDOWN AGAIN. HERE'S WHY,"With unemployment claims ballooning to 22 million people, the coronavirus lockdown took an uncomfortable turn for state governors on Wednesday. Workers and small business owners clogged the streets of Lansing, Michigan, near the capitol, blaring car and truck horns, and waved signs calling on Governor Gretchen Whitmer to allow businesses to open up. Smaller protests took place in Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, North Carolina and Utah.
The angry outburst came just as the nation teeters on what the computer models say is the ""peak"" of the COVID-19 outbreak. According to most calculations, the death toll, after rising with terrifying steepness for several weeks, should be flattening out and soon starting to drop. ""The worst is over,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo earlier this week.
Reality, though, seems to have other ideas. New Jersey, supposedly on the downward slope, reported 362 deaths on Thursday, the biggest single-day increase. Governor Phil Murphy said the death toll, at 3518, surpasses the number of state residents who died in World War I.
Despite the lack of clarity, reopening is on everybody's mind. President Donald Trump announced Thursday, ""We are in the next front of our war, which we are calling, 'Opening Up America Again.'"" Governors on both coasts are hammering out plans to lift restrictions on businesses. Governor Gavin Newsom of California said any plans to open the state would be ""guided by science and data.""
One thing is clear: regardless of whether the lockdown ends next week or next year, the virus will be waiting on the other side. A lockdown only delays the virus' progress through the population. It's designed to keep the burden off emergency rooms and intensive care units and buy time. The relevant question in considering how and when to lift the lockdown is not how to prevent deaths, but rather how to prevent too many deaths all at once.
Several private studies have laid out frameworks for a plan, and the governors are no doubt fashioning their own. There is a consensus that life will not go back to normal until scientists figure out how to defang the virus—with a vaccine, or treatments that keep the acutely ill from dying on ventilators, or both. New treatments will take months to roll out and a vaccine is at least a year away. How, then, do we negotiate the coming months?
Most plans present a post-lockdown scenario in which life wouldn't exactly be normal but would still be an improvement on lockdown. People would wear masks when they go outside, some businesses would reopen with social-distancing precautions, large gatherings would be forbidden and bars would stay closed. Baseball season might reopen, but teams would play to empty stadiums. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, an author of a report published by the American Enterprise Institute, told Vox that it would look like a ""gradual reintroduction of activity.""
As social interactions increased, of course, the virus would begin to make a comeback. Epidemiolgist Marc Lipsitch of Harvard and his colleagues recently performed a computer analysis of how SARS-CoV-2 was likely to behave after lockdown is lifted, which the journal Science published on Tuesday. The authors found that loosened restrictions would almost certainly produce a rebound later in the year. A false sense of security during the summer months in northern states such as New York and Michigan, where the virus might be less active during the summer heat, could lead to a spike in cases in the autumn or winter that's even more severe than the one we're only now recovering from.
To avoid another catastrophe, doctors would use contract tracing to jump on small outbreaks before they turn into big ones. Contact tracing would require PCR tests to detect the presence of the virus in patients' blood, and serological tests to measure the presence of antibodies, an indication of whether or not a patient has immunity. The monitoring would have to be done at the local level, which means tests would have to be cheap, plentiful and quick. Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate and professor at New York University, calls for administering tests to every person in the country every two weeks—more than 20 million tests per day.
Testing on that scale is not going to happen anytime soon. Tests are only now being rolled out and it will be ""at least weeks before there are results for more than a handful of places,"" said Lipsitch at a press conference.
Without testing and tracing, the only tool available to keep the outbreak in check is social distancing. Lipsitch's team explored scenarios for controlling the rebound with social-distancing measures alone. No one wants a permanent lockdown, so they also ran their computer models on a strategy of intermittent lockdowns. Public health officials would monitor the prevalence of the virus in the population at large and, as the number of infected people reached a certain threshold, social distancing rules would once again go into effect. A lockdown in March and April might give way to a few months of relative freedom, but then it would be time for a second lockdown, and eventually a third and a fourth and so on.
Without a vaccine or effective treatments, a strategy of on-again, off-again lockdowns would have to continue through 2022 before enough people carried antibodies to the virus to protect the most vulnerable, known as herd immunity.
It sounds awful—and it might not even work. Without adequate testing, public health officials would have to use indirect metrics, such as hospitalizations, to assess at what point a new lockdown is needed. This would hamper their ability to recognize a spike quickly enough to avoid another catastrophic increase in COVID-19 cases. Would politicians listen and act in time to close down businesses? Would the public accept and abide by these recurring rounds of restrictions?
The recent of experience of Singapore doesn't bode well. In the early days of the pandemic, Singapore, which arguably has the best health care system in the world, managed to avoid severe social distancing through a program of comprehensive testing and rigorous contact tracing. Still, it lost control of the outbreak. Last week, it had to resort to closing businesses and reducing social contact. If Singapore can't keep its economy open with a robust system of testing and monitoring, can the U.S.?
The lack of alternatives to social distancing makes charting a realistic course from lockdown to normalcy exceedingly difficult. Until scientists can come up with some other intervention—a vaccine, a treatment, a drastic expansion of ICU capacity—it looks like social distancing is going to be a way of life for a while.",politicsNews,4/17/2020,Newsweek
MITT ROMNEY IS THE ONLY REPUBLICAN SENATOR NOT ON TRUMP'S NEW CONGRESSIONAL CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE,"The White House on Thursday announced the bipartisan congressional members serving on the Trump administration's Opening Up American Again Congressional Group, and there was one Republican senator missing from the list: Mitt Romney.
President Donald Trump and members of his administration held phone calls today with Republican and Democrat Senators and Representatives serving on this new task force, the Trump administration said. The Opening Up American Again Congressional Group discussed plans to address the need for additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, ways to energize the economy, determining essential and nonessential workers, along other things related to economic recovery amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The list of congressional members includes 32 representatives and 65 senators from both sides of the aisle. All Republican senators are on the team, except Mitt Romey of Utah. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to Newsweek that Romney was not invited to be on the new task force.
Democratic senators of red states Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Doug Jones of Alabama were also not included, as well as dozens of other Democrats, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, both of whom recently dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination. Sanders is an independent, but ran as a Democrat.
During the call with Trump, the group also discussed strategies to expand America's pandemic response, such as rapidly expanding access to COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody tests, ventilators, face masks and other PPE.
Newsweek reached out to a Romney spokesperson for comment.
Romney has been a vocal Trump critic within the Republican party since he became a senator in 2019. The Utah lawmaker, who was the GOP presidential nominee in 2012, was the only Republican senator to vote for an article of impeachment against Trump in February. During the impeachment trial, Romney voted for the abuse of power charge and against the obstruction of Congress charge.
Eventually, the Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit Trump 52-48 on the abuse of power charge and 52-47 on the obstruction of Congress charge, ending Democrats' bid to remove the president from office.
Romney's impeachment vote was not the first time the senator has signaled criticism of Trump or broken with his fellow Republicans.
Trump and Romney have traded jabs for years, dating back to 2016. During Trump's presidential campaign, Romney called the candidate a ""phony"" and a ""fraud."" In response, Trump called Romney ""one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.""
The two politicians have reconciled and fallen out again since then. Trump endorsed Romney's Senate campaign in 2018, but later went on to call for the senator to be removed from the GOP caucus.",politicsNews,4/16/2020,Newsweek
"DONALD TRUMP'S TAB FOR MAGA RALLIES JUMPS TO $1.8 MILLION AS 14 CITIES SAY PRESIDENT HASN'T PAID POLICE BILLS, REPORT FINDS","President Donald Trump's campaign keeps racking up unpaid bills for police and security at his MAGA rallies, according to a new report from The Center for Public Integrity.
The report, published Thursday, found that Trump's team owes a total of $1.82 million to 14 local municipalities for public safety-related costs incurred during the president's ""Make America Great Again"" events.
That's nearly double the amount of debt that the nonprofit investigative journalism organization found in June 2019. At that time, the president's re-election effort owed at least $841,219 to 10 city governments.
Trump's team has claimed that it's not responsible for paying the bills, though the latest campaign finance data shows they have more than enough with a $100 million war chest.
That duty, they told the organization, was left to the Secret Service. The Secret Service pointed the finger at Congress, arguing that lawmakers haven't set aside any funding that would allow agents to reimburse local governments for the public safety costs.
Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for comment on the unpaid bills but did not receive a response in time for publication.
Trump's not the only candidate who has ignored bills from local municipalities for costs incurred on the campaign trail. According to an invoice from the Burlington Police Department, President Barack Obama owed a few thousand dollars for a visit to Vermont in 2012. However, many 2020 Democratic candidates and several Republicans say they always repay local officials even though it's not legally required, according to the Center for Public Integrity.
But now, amid the coronavirus pandemic, local governments are urging Trump to pay up. The COVID-19 outbreak has forced most of the country to shut down, with state officials issuing stay-at-home orders and forcing all nonessential businesses to close.
""Without this money, we cannot help our most vulnerable, and I guarantee we do not have enough money to prevent lives lost and homes lost,"" Kate Burke, a city council member in Spokane, Washington, told the Center for Public Integrity. Burke said Trump owes the city more than $65,000 from an event hosted in 2016.
Trump, like all other political candidates, has been forced to stop in-person campaigning amid the global health crisis. The last rally the president was able to hold was on March 2 in North Carolina. At the time, he was still touting low unemployment numbers and other economic achievements as the key reasons voters should re-elect him to a second term in the White House.
But now, both the message and strategy have changed. Trump's campaign has switched to an entirely digital campaign effort, holding virtual town halls and meetings. The president has also taken advantage of the previously unused White House press briefing room to deliver hours-long speeches daily on the coronavirus. And as the economy has taken a downturn—more than 20 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past four weeks—Trump has made crisis leadership the focus of his campaign.
""When somebody's president of the United States, the authority is total. And that's the way it's got to be. It's total. It's total,"" Trump declared earlier this week.",politicsNews,4/16/2020,Newsweek
"AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, DONALD TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING HITS 5-MONTH LOW IN NEW GALLUP POLL","President Donald Trump received his lowest approval rating over the past five months, according to a new Gallup poll shared on Thursday.
Conducted from April 1 to April 14, the survey asked 1,017 U.S. adults if they approved or disapproved the way Trump is handling his presidency. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
According Gallup, 43 percent of Americans approve of the way Trump is doing his job, compared to 54 percent who said they disapprove.
Trump's 43 percent approval rating shows a six-percentage point decline from a 49 percent approval rating he received in mid-March (his all-time best), while also showing the lowest rating he has received over the past five months. Trump received a 43 percent approval rating in November 2019, but has since stayed above this number throughout December, January, February and March.
The newest poll results come amid the novel coronavirus, which has spread throughout the U.S. The president has faced scrutiny for his handling of the outbreak, with many feeling that he has downplayed the severity.
""The current health and economic crisis is undoubtedly the greatest challenge of his presidency so far -- and could imperil his standing in the final year of his first term as he seeks reelection,"" said Gallup of Trump.
When looking at the president's job approval rating by political party affiliation, the poll results changed drastically with Republicans and Democrats having almost completely opposite views. According to Gallup's study, Trump received a 93 percent approval rating from Republicans, while only 7 percent of Democrats agreed. Independents' approval of Trump is at 39 percent.
Gallup also found a decrease in the level of satisfaction in regard to the direction of the U.S. The study said only 30 percent of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, a 12-percentage point drop from a previous poll conducted in March.
Once again, these percentages changed drastically when looking at political party affiliation. About 60 percent of Republicans said they were satisfied, while only 10 percent of Democrats shared the same assessment.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has strained the U.S. and its institutions in unprecedented ways, creating great challenges for leaders. It's unsurprising that fewer Americans are satisfied with the way things are going than was the case a month ago,"" according to the Gallup poll.",politicsNews,4/16/2020,Newsweek
DEMOCRATS RAISED TWICE THE MONEY REPUBLICANS DID IN FIVE 2020 RACES THAT COULD DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE SENATE,"Democratic challengers raised nearly twice the amount Republicans did in first-quarter fundraising in five must-watch races that could determine who controls the Senate, the latest campaign finance figures showed.
Republican incumbents facing tough re-elections races in Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Maine and North Carolina all raised significantly less cash than their Democratic rivals in the first three months of 2020.
These contests are some of the best opportunities Democrats have to flip the seats and regain the Senate majority in November. They're rapidly becoming some of the most expensive and contentious matchups in the country. In Kentucky, for example, the multi-million dollar ad war between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Amy McGrath started 16 months before Election Day.
In some races, such as Maine and North Carolina, Democrats actually doubled the amount of cash brought in by their Republican challengers. In Maine, state representative Sara Gideon raised nearly three times more money than four-term incumbent Susan Collins.
The Senate is now made up of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Democrats need to win four seats to regain control of the chamber, or three seats if the vice president is a Democrat. The vice president serves as the ""president of the Senate"" and can cast tie-breaking votes.
For Republicans to maintain control of the Senate, all they have to do is hold on to the seats they already have. But the GOP has far more territory to defend than Democrats: 23 of the 36 seats in play in November are held by conservatives.
""It is concerning for the Republicans as they try to hold on to these very competitive seats,"" said Ryan Winger, a Colorado-based Republican strategist and pollster, about the first-quarter fundraising numbers. ""The money is going to matter.""
Winger added that it's only going to be more difficult for candidates from both parties to fundraise amid the coronavirus pandemic. Campaigns at every level have been forced to suspend in-person events as the virus continues to spread.
""Just like it has upended so much else in life, it's also going to upend how these campaigns are not only going about raising money but also how they're spending money,"" he said.
All congressional campaigns were required to file fundraising reports for the first quarter of 2020, which ended on March 31, with the Federal Election Commission by April 15. Here's a look at where candidates stand money-wise in five of the top Senate races to watch.
Arizona
Political newcomer Mark Kelly has been one of the most prolific fundraisers of the 2020 election cycle. The Democrat challenging Republican incumbent Martha McSally reported raising $11 million between January and March. McSally's team raised $6.3 million.
McSally is facing a tough re-election effort as Arizona becomes an increasingly purple state. She actually lost her 2018 Senate bid to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema but was appointed to Congress to temporarily fill the vacant seat of John McCain. Now, she and Kelly are running to complete the final two years of his term.
A Monmouth University survey of registered voters conducted in mid-March showed Kelly 6 points ahead of McNally. But a new Arizona Public Opinion Pulse survey released on Wednesday found Kelly had already expanded his advantage to a 7-point lead.
Colorado
Incumbent Cory Gardner is considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for re-election this year as he's likely to go up against former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper outraised Gardner in the first quarter of 2020, bringing in roughly $4 million to Gardner's $2.4 million. But the Republican still has more cash on hand with $9.6 million in the bank compared with Hickenlooper's $4.9 million.
""What's clear from Senator Gardner's Q1 fundraising numbers is Coloradans want a commonsense conservative who delivers results, not a liberal socialist bent on changing America as we know it. Our campaign's cash on hand advantage will allow us to have the necessary resources to defeat the far left in 2020,"" said Casey Contres, Gardner's campaign manager.
Sabato's Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan election forecaster, shifted its rating of the Colorado Senate race from a ""toss-up"" to ""leans Democratic"" after polling showed Gardner to be unpopular with residents. The survey, conducted by Global Strategy Group in February, found that 48 percent of state voters disapproved of Gardner while just 37 percent approved of him.
Kentucky
In Kentucky, Democrat Amy McGrath outraised Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell by more than $5 million. McGrath's campaign hauled in $12.8 million in the first three months of 2020 while McConnell raised $7.8 million.
Though McGrath still has to get through a primary against several other Democrats. The contest was scheduled for May has been pushed back to June 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Two polls conducted in January showed the general election to be winnable for McGrath. In one poll she was tied with McConnell while the other showed the Republican incumbent up by just 3 percentage points. But McConnell is going to be difficult to beat considering he's the most powerful Republican in Congress and a close ally to President Donald Trump, who won Kentucky by roughly 30 points in 2016.
Maine
Republican incumbent Susan Collins trailed her expected Democratic rival in fundraising by $4 million. Democrat Sara Gideon, the speaker of Maine's House of Representatives, raked in just over $7 million this year while Collins collected $2.4 million.
The race is likely to be Collins' toughest re-election effort since being elected to the Senate in 1996. Her controversial votes against impeachment and for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court are likely to hurt her in a state President Trump lost in 2016. She's also the most unpopular Senator in Congress, according to Morning Consult, with a 52 percent disapproval rating. A poll conducted by Colby College in February showed Collins trailing Gideon by 1 percentage point.
North Carolina
Democrat Cal Cunningham has outraised Republican incumbent Thom Tillis by more than $3 million so far in 2020. Cunningham's campaign reported a $4.4 million fundraising haul between January and March. The Tillis campaign reported raising $1.3 million in the same time period.
But while Cunningham raised more money, Tillis still had more cash on hand. The Republican senator reported $6.5 million in the bank compared to Cunningham's $3 million.
Democrats won big in the 2018 midterms, signaling that the traditionally conservative state is becoming less reliably red. Polls currently show a tight race between Cunningham and Tillis. An East Carolina University survey conducted in February showed Tillis with a 2-point lead over Cunningham. But a NBC News/Marist poll from early March had Cunningham ahead by 5 percentage points. The Cook Political Report recently deemed the race a ""toss-up"" after it had been ""leaning Republican.""",politicsNews,4/16/2020,Newsweek
NORTH DAKOTA WILL BEGIN TO REOPEN STARTING ON MAY 1,"On Wednesday night, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum issued new guidelines for the state's business restrictions, suggesting that they will end on May 1.
In a statement released by his office, Burgum extended the state's business restrictions for an additional 10 days, with the end to these restrictions coming on April 30, ""and outlined a path forward for them to reopen.""
While North Dakota remains one of the few U.S. states that has not imposed a statewide stay-at-home order, they have enforced social distancing measures such as closing schools and different businesses in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
According to the statement, the businesses listed under the extended restrictions include recreational facilities, health clubs and athletic facilities, theaters, ""bars and restaurants except for take-out, delivery, curbside and drive-through,"" as well as salons, barber shops and tanning and massage facilities.
In order for the state to reopen after the 10-day extension terminates on April 30, Burgum outlined a number of different tasks that must be completed. These include, ""robust,"" widespread testing and contact tracing, targeted, effective quarantine, protection for the state's vulnerable populations, sufficient health care capacity, adequate protective equipment for healthcare workers and the public, plans for dealing with a possible resurgence of coronavirus cases and to develop ""a new standard operating procedures for reopening.""
According to the governor's statement, some of the aspects that make up the new standard operating procedure include ""daily disinfection procedures, mandatory health and hygiene protocols for employees, discontinued use of shared items, limiting the number of customers allowed into the business at one time and requiring that masks be worn inside the business.""
Burgum's plan to begin reopening the state on May 1 aligns with the plan recently mentioned by President Donald Trump. On Tuesday night, Trump said that he was planning to ask all 50 governors across the country to implement ""a very powerful reopening plan of their state in a time and manner as most appropriate.""
The president added that more than 20 states are in ""extremely good shape,"" and could open their economies, ""maybe even before the date of May 1.""
Despite Burgum's plan to reopen the state on May 1, the number of coronavirus cases in North Dakota continues to rise. According to a tracker provided by Johns Hopkins University, there are at least 365 confirmed cases in the state as well as nine deaths.
Across the U.S., there are over 640,000 confirmed cases and over 31,000 deaths.

TENNESSEE GOVERNOR BILL LEE RECOMMENDS SCHOOLS CLOSE FOR REST OF YEAR IN CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN EXTENSION,"Tennessee Governor Bill Lee recommended that schools remain closed for the rest of the school year.
In a briefing on Wednesday evening, Governor Lee recommended that schools across the state close, but stopped short of enforcing closures. Lee said he hoped that schools would follow his recommendation, and after the briefing, counties across the state announced that they would be closing.
WVLT8 reported that Knox, Morgan, Blount, Claiborne, Campbell, Hamblen and Monroe counties announced that they would be closing their schools for the rest of the academic year.
In a tweet, Governor Lee wrote: ""In order to keep every Tennessean safe during this pandemic, I am recommending that schools remain closed through the end of this school year.
""We're working with [the Tennessee Department of Education] and local leaders to ensure there is flexibility for districts to complete critical year-end activities.""
In a bulletin posted on the Tennessee government website, the state government said: ""Students have lost significant learning time in their classrooms and the administration is committed to continuing to provide resources that keep our students engaged.
""Time lost in the classroom also has implications on overall well being, especially for at-risk and vulnerable student populations.""
The bulletin also explains that the Tennessee Department of Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn will convene a COVID-19 Child Wellbeing Task Force ""to engage communities and provide support for students.""
Schwinn retweeted Lee's announcement on Twitter and explained what the task force would do: ""Proud to be a part of this work, supporting our children's wellbeing while continuing to support their academic progress.
""Over the coming weeks, we will convene a task force to consider critical issues like nutrition, health, and services to support the work our schools do every day.""
Many states have already ordered schools to close for the rest of the academic year, including Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, according to Education Week.
California, Idaho, Maine, South Dakota, and now Tennessee, have recommended, but not ordered, that schools close for the rest of the academic year.
Some states have only closed schools temporarily with schools set to re-open this month in Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
Other states have extended their school closures to May, including Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Washington, D.C.

JOY BEHAR CALLS ANTI-LOCKDOWN PROTESTERS ‘TERRORISTS’ INSPIRED BY ALEX JONES,"The View co-host Joy Behar blamed the nationwide anti-lockdown protests on Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh and referred to the demonstrators who brought guns to the events as terrorists.
“Well, you know, let me first say that we are lucky to be working from home, all of us. I feel for these people who are losing their jobs. I really do. But they have to understand that they can infect other people,” Behar said Monday.
“You know to paraphrase Patrick Henry, give me liberty and give me death is what they are basically proposing because a lot of people are going to die because of this behavior. It has already been shown that self-quarantining, whatever you want to call it, besides distancing and PPE’s, has been working. It works.”

“These people are being egged on by right-wing media and people like Alex Jones, like Rush Limbaugh. Why are you bringing guns to a rally? You want to call yourself protesters leave your guns home.

TWITTER BANS INFOWARS REPORTERS DAYS AHEAD OF “REOPEN TEXAS” RALLY,"Twitter suspended the accounts of Infowars reporters Owen Shroyer and Rob Dew Thursday, after a Media Matters hit piece claimed the social media platform was “facilitating” the promotion of a rally at the Texas capitol this weekend.
The suspensions came mere hours after a Media Matters article questioning whether a recent Periscope livestream, in which Shroyer promoted an upcoming Reopen America rally in Austin set for Saturday, violated the company’s guidelines on content that “could place people at a higher risk of transmitting COVID-19.”
Twitter users expressed shock and dismay at the censorship efforts, with media commentator Mark Dice among the first to connect Media Matters with the suspensions:
“It’s sad that they would start censoring people in the middle of a global pandemic,” Shroyer said in an exclusive statement.
“You’d think it goes against everything they’ve been saying, yet if they really wanted to do something about the spread of the coronavirus you’d think they’d want to be calling out China and the World Health Organization, but they’re not doing that – their propaganda continues to spread on Twitter.”
“I don’t think it was about that though… I think this was about the ‘Pedogate 2020’ documentary that I shared twice but as Kaitlin Bennett put out, this is clearly nothing to do with abusive behavior, because they allow death threats to happen to her everyday, but then they censor my account for either covering coronavirus or daring to do a livestream, or daring to share a documentary.
“So this is just more Nazi-style censorship from the technocrat left and Nazis at Twitter.”
Despite the Twitter account suspensions, the “You Can’t Close America” rally is set for Saturday, April 18th, 2020 from 12PM-2PM Central, on the steps of the Texas capitol.
The demonstration aims to give Texans of all stripes a voice to protest the authoritarian lockdown orders being imposed by petty tyrants at the local level.

JONES VS TRUMP: INFOWARS PREPARES TO FILE LAWSUIT IF TRUMP DECLARES MARTIAL LAW/INTERSTATE TRAVEL BAN,"Alex Jones is readying a lawsuit against the Trump administration if it imposes an unconstitutional interstate travel ban to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
The lawsuit, to be filed through a Washington D.C. District Court if Trump follows through, claims the president’s decision to impose an interstate travel restriction violates the Constitution, and is driven by political expediency rather than lawful precedent.
“In our view, while the COVID-19 crisis does present a real and present danger to public health, there is also something significant at stake, and that is our fundamental freedoms and rights as Americans,” lawyer Norm Pattis said on The Alex Jones Show Monday. “We have drafted a lawsuit titled Alex Jones v. Donald Trump, naming a number of Trump’s Cabinet officials, in the event that President Trump announces an interstate travel ban or something like it.”
“We will go immediately into a District of Columbia court and ask for injunctive declaratory relief,” he added. “In other words, a ruling from a judge that the action is unlawful, and an order from the judge barring implementation of it. If that judge rejects our claim, we we’ll go to the D.C. Court of Appeals. If that court rejects our claim we will seek a hearing in the United States Supreme Court.”
From Alex Jones:
“When I do this, it’s not because it’s President Trump, I like President Trump. The globalists definitely hate him, but they’ve maneuvered him into this impossible choice, this rock and a hard place, because if he doesn’t respond, they’ll just trigger riots and other crises, and the media will trigger hysteria. Either he comes in with the clampdown or the globalists do it and brush him aside and make him irrelevant. The left has celebrated it. We said ‘Trump, look out! They’re setting you up.’ We were absolutely right.”
Trump will hold another coronavirus task force briefing Monday afternoon at 2:30 CDT, where he may possibly make his domestic travel ban announcement.

"INDICTMENTS AGAINST OBAMA’S DEEP STATERS MAY COME THIS WEEK, SAYS JOURNALIST","John Durham, the lead investigator looking into the FBI’s 2016 Crossfire Hurricane spy operation against Donald Trump’s presidential campaign may deliver several indictments against Obama-era officials, according to investigative journalist John Solomon.
In an interview Friday with Fox Business’ Lou Dobbs, Solomon explained that new materials released by the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the FISA abuses against Trump’s campaign reveal the surveillance operation against him was far more corrupt than previously believed.
“In my worst nightmare I could not have imagined what would come out this week,” Solomon told Dobbs. “The level of information that the FBI had that raised red flags that they should have never not even for a moment entertained Chris Steele as a human source as a confidential informant is now overwhelming.”
“Christopher Steele should never have been shown the door inside the FBI and instead we sustained two-and-a-half years of an investigation into false allegations that put this country and this president through an unnecessary process,” he added.
After Dobbs complained about the lack of accountability against the Deep State cabal that perpetrated its bureaucratic coup against Trump, Solomon assured him that justice may still be served.
“There is fairly significant evidence that at this very moment, this week, the last couple of weeks Lou that there is some criminal investigative activity that I think will result in some action coming out soon,” Solomon said.
“It’s not going to be a lot. Don’t expect 10 or 12 indictments but there could be a handful of indictments and much more information.”
Owen takes calls from people who are sick and tired of this “panic-demic” and want President Trump to take action.

ELON MUSK: “WHAT I FIND MOST SURPRISING IS THAT CNN STILL EXISTS”,"Elon Musk called out CNN for erroneously reporting that more than 1,000 ventilators sent by Tesla to California hospitals hadn’t been received while expressing his surprise that the news network “still exists.”
Last month, Musk said in a tweet that he had obtained the ventilators due to China having an oversupply and would be shipping them free to hospitals that required them.
CNN published a story claiming that “none of the promised ventilators have been received by hospitals,” citing Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office.
Musk responded by tweeting, “What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists.”
He then posted an email exchange which shows a Los Angeles County Department of Health Services official thanking Tesla for receiving the ventilators.
“Hey Phillip, do you know if these ventilators went into use?” asks Tesla’s Omead Afshar.
“They worked great during testing today,” responded Phillip Franks, who is Director of System Operations and Support Services at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. “We will put these to use tomorrow. Thanks!” he adds.
Musk also tagged Gov. Gavin Newsom in one of the tweets, asking him to “please fix this misunderstanding.”
We await to see if CNN will fix their totally inaccurate reporting.

TRUMP WAS WARNED ABOUT NIH CORRUPTION IN 2015,"Presidential candidate Donald Trump was warned about corruption at the National Institute of Health in October 2015 by conservative radio host Michael Savage.
Trump, who had announced his candidacy for president a few months earlier, joined The Savage Nation to discuss his policy platform when Savage broached the corruption at the NIH, suggesting Trump appoint him to head the institute should he be elected.
“We have such corruption right now in science itself, that’s there’s virtually almost no real honest science anymore, and the best evidence I have for that is the fake global warming research,” Savage told Trump.
“Almost every study comes out that’s warped, it’s all corrupt.”
“When you become President, I want you consider appointing me to head of the NIH,” Savage continued. “I will make sure that America has real science and real medicine again in this country because I know the corruption. I know how to clean it up and I know how to make real research work again.”
“I hear so much about the NIH and it’s terrible beyond belief,” Trump said.
The NIH has come under fire after documents surfaced showing the institute gave the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Communist China a $3.7 million grant to conduct gain-of-function coronavirus experimentation on bats in 2017.
In other words, the NIH outsourced its coronavirus research to the Communist Chinese.
Additionally, the coronavirus mortality models touted by NIH Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx have turned out to be incredibly inaccurate and overblown as the pandemic rolled on, drawing criticism from many medical experts and citizens obeying stay-at-home orders.

CNN’S CUOMO SUDDENLY REALISES HIS JOB IS ‘TRAFFICKING IN THE RIDICULOUS’,"CNN anchor Chris Cuomo made a startling confession Monday, declaring that he doesn’t value his job and that CNN is “trafficking in things that I think are ridiculous.”
In a Howard Beale-esq moment, Cuomo made the comments on his SiriusXM show, apparently having an epiphany after contracting coronavirus.
“I don’t want to spend my time doing things that I don’t think are valuable enough to me personally,” Cuomo said, adding “I don’t value indulging the rationality, hyper-partisanship.”
Listen:
“I don’t like what I do professionally,” Cuomo said. “I don’t think it’s worth my time.”
Cuomo also said that he dislikes “talking to Democrats about things that I don’t really believe they mean” and “talking to Republicans about them parroting things they feel they have to say.”
The host seems to be reevaluating his role in the fake news system that has become purely about winning ratings by saying ridiculous things.
“I don’t think its worth it to me because I don’t think I mean enough, I don’t think I matter enough, I don’t think I can really change anything, so then what am I really doing?” Cuomo continued.
“I’m basically being perceived as successful in a system that I don’t value. I’m seen as being good at being on TV and advocating for different positions… but I don’t know if I value those things, certainly not as much as I value being able to live my life on my own terms.” he added.
The host also related an experience about being approached by a biker on Easter Sunday, being verbally abused while he was out with his family, adding that he wants to be able to act like any other member of the public, so he told the biker to ‘go to hell’.
“I don’t want some jackass, loser, fat tire biker being able to pull over and get in my space and talk bullsh** to me, I don’t want to hear it.” Cuomo ranted.
“That matters to me more than making millions of dollars a year…because I’ve saved my money and I don’t need it anymore. I want to be able to tell you to go to hell, to shut your mouth…I don’t get that doing what I do for a living.” he added.
Last year, Cuomo made headlines when he was caught on video threatening a guy who called him ‘Fredo’, the name of the ‘weak’ middle brother in ‘The Godfather’.
Cuomo told the person that he would “f***ing throw you down the stairs like a f***ing punk”:
“So, I’m gonna make changes,” Cuomo concluded. “Why? Because I’ve gotta be happy. Why? Because life is short. Life is short. And I’m pretty far down the road – I’m gonna be 50.”
He also admitted that he doesn’t want to be like other network anchors who are open about their partisanship.
“I’ll never be Sean Hannity. I’ll never have this mass following that echoes a political set of ideas and principles that I’ll agree with. Similarly, Rachel Maddow.” Cuomo announced.
It seems that Cuomo is ‘mad as hell and he aint gonna take it no more!’

"TRUMP SHOWS MONTAGE OF MEDIA DOWNPLAYING CORONAVIRUS — CNN, MSNBC CUT FEED","President Trump set the record straight during a White House coronavirus task force briefing after the media tried to claim he didn’t act to mitigate the pandemic soon enough.
During the briefing Monday, Trump stepped aside to let a video montage play showing numerous media figures from January and February downplaying and dismissing the severity of the coronavirus crisis, and other Democrat leaders praising Trump for his response efforts.
The montage was so effective at exposing the media’s hypocrisy and bias that CNN and MSNBC immediately cut the feed, claiming the president was broadcasting “propaganda.”
“We are going to avoid airing any more of this White House briefing until it returns to what it was supposed to be, which was the coronavirus task force providing medical information,” said MSNBC Chief Legal Correspondent Ari Melber.
ABC’s Jon Karl asked Trump: “I have never seen a video like that played in this room…Why did you feel the need to do that?”
“Because we’re getting Fake News & I’d like to have it corrected,” Trump replied.
The mainstream media has cut away from Trump’s task force briefings several times and has called for boycotting future briefings after he floated hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for coronavirus.
Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit joins The Alex Jones Show to expose what the massively over-projected casualties from COVID-19 mean as the MSM claims credit for impossibly low by comparison real numbers.

BERNIE ENDORSES BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT,"Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has endorsed presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden for president.
The Vermont senator made the announcement in an interview with Biden on Monday, saying: “We need you in the White House. I will do all that I can to see that that happens, Joe.”
The former vice president expressed his gratitude for the socialist “outsider’s” endorsement.
“I thank you for your endorsement, your support…it means a great deal to me personally,” Biden told Sanders.
Bernie’s acquiescence to the establishment is notable given his anti-establishment platform and forceful rhetoric.
This isn’t the first time Sanders bent the knee to the establishment.
In 2016, Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton despite the former Secretary of State plotting to steal the Democratic nomination from him, as revealed by WikiLeaks.
“I have come here to make it as clear as possible why I am endorsing Hillary Clinton and why she must become our next president,” Sanders had said at a joint rally in New Hampshire. “Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nomination and I congratulate her for that.”

DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR WHITMER ADDS U.S. FLAGS TO LIST OF BANNED PRODUCTS DURING LOCKDOWN,"Michigan’s Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer expanded on her draconian list of forbidden items to purchase during the coronavirus lockdown — which now includes the U.S. flag.
Whitmer had prohibited the sale of seeds, gardening products, and other items she deemed “non-essential” in an executive order on Thursday, prompting outrage from businesses and individuals in the state.
But now it seems U.S. flags are another item Whitmer arbitrarily deemed “non-essential.”
Whitmer’s overreaching behavior was already established after she attempted to limit doctors from using hydroxycholoroquine for coronavirus treatment last month to score political points against President Trump.
But she changed course last week after receiving widespread criticism for the move, and is now asking the federal government for shipments of the drug.
Why does every move Democrats make during this crisis tend to exercise authoritarianism rather than genuinely help the American people during the pandemic?
For example, Kentucky’s Democrat Governor Andy Beshear threatened to record the license plates of and quarantine Easter Sunday churchgoers, regardless of whether they test positive for COVID-19 or not.

‘WOKE’ REPORTER ACCUSES BLACK SURGEON GENERAL OF RACISM FOR SAYING ‘BIG MOMMA’,"A far-left activist reporter accused Surgeon General Jerome Adams of racism after he urged people of color to follow to follow the safety guidelines to stop the spread of the coronavirus, including avoiding drugs and alcohol.
Adams, a black man himself, said: “Do it for your Abuela, do it for your Grandaddy, do it for your Big Momma, do it for your Pop Pop.”
But PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor took issue with Adams choice of words, claiming his language was offensive.
“You said that African-Americans and Latinos should avoid alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. You also said do it for your Abuela and do it for Big Mama and Pop-Pop,” Alcindor said to Adams. “There are some people online that are already offended by that language and the idea that you’re saying behaviors might be leaning to these high death rates.”
“I use the language that is used in my family,” Adams responded, noting that his own family used the terms “Grandaddy” and “Big Mama.”
“That was not meant to be offensive. That’s the language that I use and they use,” he added.
Alcindor’s liberal activism during the White House coronavirus task force briefings have made headlines in recent days.
For example, she badgered President Trump over unverified reports that a White House staffer referred to the coronavirus as the “Kung Flu,” and suggested he was racist for calling it the “Chinese virus.”
But accusing a black man of racism for saying “Big Momma” and “Pop Pop” represents a new low for the media.
It was only a few weeks ago when leftist media talking heads like Don Lemon and many others had no problem calling COVID-19 the “Wuhan Chinese Virus”. So why has it suddenly become politically incorrect to say the virus came from China? Because the MSM has received their marching orders from Beijing to change the narrative and launch yet another disinformation campaign to blame President Trump for being racist.

BERNIE’S PRESS SECRETARY: ‘NOW I CAN DROP ‘DEMOCRATIC’ FROM ‘DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM’,"After he announced he was suspending his presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders’ press secretary expressed relief that she could finally drop the word “democratic” from the term “democratic socialism.”
The mask comes off.
Sanders announced he was bowing out of the race earlier today telling his supporters during a live stream that the decision was “very difficult and painful” while acknowledging there was no feasible path to the nomination.
Briahna Joy Gray, Bernie’s press secretary had a very revealing response, tweeting, “On the plus side, I can drop the “Democratic” from my tweets about why Socialism is good.”
The term “democratic socialism” has long been used by Bernie’s campaign as a thin veil to disguise the fact that he is a command and control socialist and his policies have more in common with dictatorial socialist countries than anything America has ever seen.
“Democratic socialism” was originally coined by social democrats in the 20th century who wanted to emphasize that they saw a path to socialism through peaceful reform, not authoritarian tyranny as seen in Russia.
By eschewing the term “democratic,” Gray is basically admitting that the impetus behind Bernie’s campaign was authoritarian from the very beginning.
This correlates with frightening statements made by Bernie’s hardcore supporters and his own campaign staff.
A series of videos released by Project Veritas earlier this year featured Bernie staffers confirming with their own words just how “democratic” they envisioned their brand of socialism to be.
“I’m ready to start tearing bricks up and start fighting. I’m no cap, bro,” said South Carolina field organizer Martin Weissgerber in one oft he videos. “I’ll straight up get armed, I want to learn how to shoot and go train. I’m ready for the f**ing revolution, bro.”
“I’m telling you. Guillotine the rich,” he added.
Another campaign organizer named Kyle Jurek was captured on camera advocating re-education camps for Trump supporters while vowing that that “Milwaukee will burn” if Sanders didn’t get the nomination.

GLENWOOD SPRINGS PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER MANDATES CITIZENS WEAR FACE MASKS OR RECEIVE UP TO A YEAR IN JAIL,"A new public health order voted on by council officials in Glenwood Springs, Colorado mandates citizens wear a face mask when they enter a shop, with the punishment being up to a year in jail.
The city’s public health order, which passed by a 6-1 council vote, requires people to wear the masks “when entering and while inside of a place or conveyance open to the public” and “for all essential activities outside of their home.”
The punishment for not wearing a mask is a fine of up to $1,000 or 364 days in jail.
City attorney Karl Hanlon explained that the order does not mandate residents wear masks when they leave their homes, but as soon as they encounter a situation in a public place where people cannot maintain safe social distancing, the masks become mandatory.
Face coverings such as bandanas and scarves can be used in place of medical masks because there is currently a shortage and officials don’t want residents to put a strain on supply.
Councilor Tony Hershey, who voted against the law, said it went too far.
“As a more conservative person, I can’t support micromanaging people’s lives,” Hershey told the Aspen Times. “To some extent we have to legislate… but this is a city council, we should do it in cooperation with the county government and with the state government and, yes, with the federal government.”
“This has officially gone TOO FAR. Insane,” remarked Robby Starbuck. “I support using masks to limit the spread but throwing a person in jail for a year over not wearing one is a gigantic overreach of power that tramples on the core values of America,” he added.

REGISTERED NURSE THREATENS TO DENY TRUMP SUPPORTER CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT,"A self-proclaimed registered nurse took to Twitter to suggest that she would not give someone emergency medical treatment for coronavirus if he was a Trump supporter.
The nurse was responding to a man called George S. Martan who posted a photo of himself wearing a face mask with ‘Trump 2020’ embroidered onto it.
“My wife sewed this face mask today to protect me from the Wuhan Virus and show support for President Trump,” commented the man.
“I’ll see you in ER. Please wear your mask so when we have to decide who gets the vent, it’ll be easier. Thanks,” responded Erika Waters, who describes herself as a registered nurse practitioner in her bio.
Waters has several anti-Trump hashtags in her bio, including #Resist, #GunReform and #BLM (Black Lives Matter).
She immediately faced the wrath of other Twitter users, including one who pointed out, “Medical homicide via negligence is the third leading cause of death in the United States.”
Others tagged the Florida medical board in an attempt to alert health authorities to the threat, with one tweeting, “Hope your medical malpractice carrier doesn’t see this.”
Waters later claimed that people were targeting the wrong nurse with the same name, remarking, “Your conduct is just as horrid as mine while you are doxxing every nurse named Erika Waters.”
She also subsequently apologized to Martan, tweeting, “I was not thinking, obviously, when I suggested you wear your mask into the ER where I work. I can’t explain why I tweeted that and hope you’ll forgive me but understand if you don’t.”

SEN. TED CRUZ RIPS NBC NEWS FOR PARROTING CHINESE COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA,"Several prominent political figures, including Ted Cruz have slammed NBC News for consistently repeating Communist Chinese government talking points in their output.
The Texas Senator linked to an NBC News article which read “U.S. reports 1,264 coronavirus deaths in over 24 hours. Meanwhile in China, where the pandemic broke out, not a single new coronavirus death was reported.”
Cruz tweeted, “Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, 22 USC 611 et seq, I’m pretty sure NBC is now legally obligated to close every broadcast with—and append to every tweet—’this message paid for by the Communist Party of China.’”
Joining the Senator in bashing the network was GOP Congressman Doug Collins, who linked to the same piece and wrote “Strange that the media is so skeptical about hydroxychloroquine, yet so willing to believe propaganda from the Chinese Communist Party.”
“They hate @realdonaldtrump more than they love America.” Collins added.
The Representative from Georgia fired off a second tweet noting that China’s numbers are clearly fake, yet NBC is repeating them in order to “undercut” President Trump.
Joining Cruz and Collins was former South Carolina Republican Governor Nikki Haley.
The former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations tweeted “Come on @NBCNews. This is embarrassing. You discredit yourself when you tout China’s propaganda. #KnowYourSource”
It is widely accepted now that China is lying about the true scale of the outbreak within its borders. The country is also engaging in disgusting profiteering from the crisis.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that a Chinese Communist mouthpiece who was able to ask President Trump questions at the White House earlier this week is a member of the White House Correspondents Association.
“As a result, she became a member of the White House Foreign Press Group because she not only is a member of the WHCA, but also has a ‘hard pass’ to be in the White House Briefing Room that was granted to her by the current administration,” said White House Foreign Press Group’s secretary Richard Latendresse.
“This reporter is therefore part of our regular rotation of members who have access to our seat during press briefings in the White House,” he told The Daily Caller.
Senator Cruz pointed to the exchange between the reporter and Trump, labelling it “disgraceful and reckless” that Phoenix TV is allowed into the press briefings.

MSM CONTINUES PUSHING CHINA CORONAVIRUS PROPAGANDA WITHOUT VETTING INFORMATION,"The mainstream corporate media is unquestioningly regurgitating Chinese propaganda that it’s experiencing no new coronavirus deaths, despite the communist nation’s lack of transparency and history of downplaying the coronavirus severity.

Conservative journalists, politicians, and political analysts condemned the media’s eager willingness to readily report anything China says without independent verification or vetting of the information.
As we reported, China has gone to great lengths to suppress coronavirus reporting, purging US media from within its country and waging an information war to deflect blame for releasing the virus.

"OANN BARRED FROM WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFINGS, BUT CHINESE PROPAGANDA OUTLET ALLOWED IN","Hong Kong Phoenix TV is a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party.
The left-wing White House Correspondents Association barred conservative network OANN from White House press briefings on coronavirus yet continues to allow access to a reporter from a station which is a mouthpiece for Chinese Communist Party propaganda.
The WHCA voted on April 1st to bar OANN’s White House correspondent Chanel Rion from the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force press briefings after Rion said during one of her questions to Trump, “Major left-wing media, even in this room, have teamed up with Chinese communist party narratives.”
OANN, which is owned by Herring Networks, Inc., an American family run business, is not welcome according to WHCA, but a news network that directly amplifies Chinese fake news propaganda about COVID-19 has retained its access to President Trump.
During his briefing yesterday, Trump asked a female reporter from Hong Kong Phoenix TV if her network was Chinese state media.
The woman claimed that the network was from Hong Kong and privately owned, falsely creating the impression that Hong Kong Phoenix TV is in fact anti-Beijing.
In reality, the station routinely amplifies Chinese state propaganda and the Hoover Institution regards it as a “quasi-official” news outlet with links to the Chinese government’s ministry of state security.
In a 2017 report, Freedom House revealed that the channel is owned by a former Chinese military officer with close ties to Beijing and has even “been used as an outlet for airing televised confessions by various detained CCP critics, most notably all five Hong Kong booksellers abducted by Chinese security forces in late 2015.”
“As for their ownership breakdown, founding chairman Liu Changle, a “former People’s Libertarian Army propaganda official who is close to senior Chinese government leaders,” owns 37.1% of the shares,” writes Matt Palumbo. “Another 20% of the network is owned by Extra Step Investments Limited, which is owned by China Mobile Hong Kong, which is owned by China mobile…. which is owned by (you guessed it) the Chinese government.”
Representatives of the Chinese government have repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was responsible for leaking coronavirus, an incredibly harmful conspiracy that has largely gone unchallenged by anti-Trump mainstream media networks in the U.S.
Meanwhile, the one news outlet in the White House press briefing room apart from Fox News that is vaguely pro-Trump is banned while literal Chinese state media mouthpieces are still given access.

CBS TWEETS NURSE’S PHONY STORY ABOUT BEING FORCED TO TREAT CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS WITHOUT A MASK,"Fake news.
CBS News posted a video of a crying nurse who claimed she was forced to quit her job after being asked to work in a coronavirus ICU without a face mask, only for it to emerge that the woman hadn’t worked at the hospital for over a year.
“In tears, a nurse says she quit her job after she was asked to work in a coronavirus ICU without a face mask: “America is not prepared, and nurses are not being protected,” stated the text accompanying the video posted by CBS News, which received over 8 million views on Twitter.
The network appeared to have conducted no research into the claim whatsoever, as it was quickly revealed that the woman was an Instagram “influencer” who hadn’t been at the hospital “for over a year” according to her own Facebook post.
The woman, Imaris Vera, also said that she suffered from anxiety and bi-polar depression and had been triggered by the coronavirus “information overload.”
CBS’ later responded to their own tweet by stating, “The hospital, Northwestern Medicine, acknowledged that Imaris Vera had quit her job, but referred CBS News to Vera as to the details of why.”
Bernie Sanders’ staff didn’t bother to check the veracity of the story either before tweeting it out to the Senator’s 9.5 million followers and calling on the on the Department of Labor to respond by issuing emergency workplace standards
“Nurses and medical workers are working tirelessly with inadequate protection gear, and they are the real heroes. For an Instagram “influencer” to deliberately misrepresent her career for the instant glorification of internet fame is sickening,” writes Chrissy Clark.
Another Twitter user posted a video of the same woman talking about coronavirus while acting noticeably less upset.
Another person compared her story to that of Jussie Smollett.

"BANNON FLAMES KISSINGER OVER CHINESE COMMUNIST TIES, VOWS ‘NUREMBURG-TYPE TRIAL’ AGAINST CCP FOR UNLEASHING VIRUS","‘You propped up the Chinese Communist Party, and not just that, you took the blood money from them,’ he says
Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon unloaded on the Chinese Communist Party and its globalist cohorts in a fiery rant on his podcast Monday, vowing that they would face a massive reckoning from humanity for releasing the coronavirus then covering it up.
“The Chinese Communist Party is responsible for all the dead, all the destruction of wealth throughout the world. The people in Wuhan were treated like animals by the Chinese Communist Party. They bore the brunt of this,” Bannon said on “War Room” Monday.
“Here’s what’s going to happen, ultimately. We’re going to have a Nuremburg-type trial. It’s going to take place in Wuhan. The Chinese Communist Party leaders are going to be on the docket, and the jury – representing mankind – will be the average citizen in Wuhan, and they will stand in judgment of these devils. And they’re going to be held accountable.”
Bannon then went off on top globalist advocate Henry Kissinger over his recent editorial claiming the coronavirus could be the way to implement the final stages of the “liberal world order.”
“Henry Kissinger? Give me a break. It’s disgusting,” Bannon fumed. “Henry Kissinger, I do not need to hear from you about the liberal world order. You are guilty, sir. You think you have blood on your hands from the bombings back in the Vietnam War? You have blood on your hands for this.”
“You have been the mouthpiece and the prop for these people from the beginning. You propped up the Chinese Communist Party, and not just that, you took the blood money from them. You’ve been paid for decades by the Chinese Communist Party.”
“It’s all gonna come out,” Bannon continued. “All the Wall Street guys who’ve been in business with them, all the corporatists in business with them, all the think tank guys in business with them, taking blood money. It’s all coming out. Okay? We’re telling you: it’s all gonna come out.”
“And the world is gonna stand in judgment of you. Because you’re just as bad as the devils, in fact, you’re worse. Because you didn’t even believe in their ideology. You believed in the money. You took it for money. You make me sick.” he added.
It’s unclear how a major trial against the CCP will take place in Wuhan, but such an event would be a major catalyst for bringing accountability to the perpetrators who unleashed the coronavirus upon humanity.

NEW YORK TO START BURYING CORONAVIRUS VICTIMS IN PARKS,"“Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line.”
New York is so overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus victims that it will have to start burying bodies in mass graves at parks, according to the city’s council health committee chairman.
New York City council health committee chairman Mark D. Levine said today on Twitter that the system is experiencing “the equivalent of an ongoing 9/11” and that managing the sheer number of dead bodies is becoming a struggle.
“Every part of this system is now backed up,” said Levine. “A typical hospital morgue might hold 15 bodies. Those are now all full. So OCME has sent out 80 refrigerated trailers to hospitals around the city. Each trailer can hold 100 bodies. These are now mostly full too. Some hospitals have had to add a 2nd or even a 3rd trailer.”
Levine explains that grieving families are calling multiple funeral homes but they are just not able to cope with the sheer volume of deaths.
“Cemeteries are not able to handle the number of burial requests and are turning most down,” said Levine.
The solution is about as grisly as you can imagine – mass graves of victims buried in parks.
“Soon we’ll start ‘temporary interment’. This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right). Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line,” said Levine.
The health official said such scenes would be “tough for NYers to take,” but would represent a better outcome than the military having to collect bodies from churches and even the streets as happened in Italy.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed the situation today by announcing that the city “may well be dealing with temporary burials.”

"40,000 LANDED IN U.S. FROM CHINA AFTER TRUMP’S TRAVEL BAN","4,000 landed in America from Wuhan in the first half of January.
New data reveals that nearly 40,000 people have landed in the United States from China after President Trump imposed the coronavirus travel ban.
“The travel data finds that since Trump’s travel ban, close to 40,000 people landed in the U.S. from China,” reports Breitbart. “Since New Year’s Eve, about 430,000 people landed in the U.S. on direct flights from China — thousands of which traveled directly from Wuhan, China, while mostly arriving in California, New York, Illinois, Washington, Michigan, and New Jersey.”
These states have since all become epicenters of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States.
Travelers were allowed to enter the country despite the ban due to ‘chain migration’ laws which allow relatives of American citizens to enter with minimal or non-existent health screenings.
The data also reveals that in the first half of January alone, some 4,000 people entered the United States from Wuhan, with 19 of those flights landing in California and New York.
As we highlighted last week, in the three months before Trump imposed the travel ban and when coronavirus was raging, 759,493 people entered the U.S. from China.
This number included 228,000 Americans who were returning home, meaning that roughly half a million were Chinese citizens or people living in China who were visiting the U.S. for tourism, business or to see family.
While all this was happening, the World Health Organization was demanding countries not engage in “stigmatization” by enforcing any kind of border controls.

"Senate Approves Aid for Small-Business Loan Program, Hospitals and Testing","The Senate passed a $484 billion relief package, after Democrats and Trump administration officials finalized an agreement.
WASHINGTON — The Senate approved a $484 billion coronavirus relief package on Tuesday that would revive a depleted loan program for distressed small businesses and provide funds for hospitals and coronavirus testing, breaking a partisan impasse over the latest infusion of federal money to address the public health and economic crisis brought on by the pandemic.
The measure was the product of an intense round of negotiations between Democrats and the Trump administration that unfolded as the small-business loan program created by the $2.2 trillion stimulus law quickly ran out of funding, collapsing under a glut of applications from desperate companies struggling to stay afloat.
But it was only a fraction of the amount of money that Congress will most likely consider in the weeks to come, as lawmakers contemplate spending another $1 trillion or more on yet another sweeping government response to the pandemic, and Democrats vow to revisit items that the administration and Republicans insisted on leaving aside for a future bill.
At the insistence of Democrats, the measure would provide $25 billion for testing and a mandate that the Trump administration establish a national strategy to help states and localities, which are required to outline their own plans for testing. It is a step that public health experts and governors have said will be crucial to allowing states and sectors of the economy to safely reopen in the weeks and months to come, although economists and health researchers say the funding is a fraction of what will ultimately be necessary to deploy the kind of testing and tracing that will be needed to restart large amounts of activity by the summer.
That provision — which the White House and Republican leaders had initially resisted — was one of a host of concessions that Democrats won during more than a week of intense negotiations in which they demanded that the money for the small-business loan program be coupled with funds for other urgent needs.
The resulting deal would bring to $2.7 trillion the amount of federal aid that Congress has approved in the past six weeks — including jobless aid, direct payments to individuals, a corporate bailout and other help for strapped businesses — in an unprecedented effort to respond to the pandemic and the economic chaos it has wrought.
It came as Southern states took their first tentative steps toward reopening, even in the face of warnings from public health experts against moving too quickly. The death toll from the virus climbed past 39,000, and the stock market fell for a second straight day, as global markets retreated and oil prices continued their record slide.
Even as the measure was being completed, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York met with President Trump at the White House to press for more federal assistance to expand testing for the virus and more funds to help financially devastated state and local governments.
The Senate approval came two weeks after Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, first asked Congress for an expedited infusion of $250 billion to shore up the newly created loan program for distressed small businesses, known as the Paycheck Protection Program.
Since Mr. Mnuchin’s request, funding has lapsed and the program has been unable to process applications for millions of companies. But Democrats rejected the administration’s request to pass a stand-alone bill funding the program and called for a package twice as large, proposing more money for hospitals, testing and state and local governments. Republicans, for their part, said they agreed with most of the Democratic requests — but initially advocated addressing additional funding in future legislation.
“We are coming together — we have our usual arguments and talking points,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, in an interview after the vote. “But in the end, we did come together for the country.”
The measure would provide $320 billion for the small-business loan program, with $60 billion set aside for smaller lending institutions, in line with Democrats’ request to steer resources to businesses that typically have trouble getting loans. The package would also add $60 billion for the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief funds — divided into $50 billion in loans and $10 billion in grants — and farms and other agriculture enterprises would be made eligible.
There would also be $75 billion for hospitals, though Democrats failed to secure additional funds for state and local governments, or an expansion of food assistance they had championed.
Republicans “have seen the light — we had a great victory for the American people,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said during a news conference at the Capitol after the vote. “But we certainly need to do more.”
Even as he hailed the agreement, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said it should have contained far more for states and localities that are struggling under the burdens of the pandemic.
“The efforts of individual states or individual citizens — heroic as they are — will not be enough, and we dare not abandon them in these dark times,” he said. “The American people need their government. They need their government to act strongly, boldly and wisely.”
The House was expected to pass the measure on Thursday, clearing it for Mr. Trump, who indicated in a post on Twitter that he would sign it. Once he did, the president wrote, discussions would begin over yet another round of coronavirus relief that would include money for state and local governments, investments in infrastructure, tax incentives for restaurants, entertainment and sports and payroll tax cuts, the latter of which has repeatedly been rejected by lawmakers in both parties.
The impasse remained charged until minutes before the vote on Tuesday afternoon, as negotiators haggled over the final details. The Senate passed the measure by voice vote — a necessity because most senators were not present as the chamber had been in a prolonged recess — after two Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, raised objections to the cost of the package and its approval without the full chamber present.
“Even more alarming than the money is the idea that one senator can stand on the floor and pass legislation spending half a trillion dollars and have no recorded vote and no debate,” said Mr. Paul, a libertarian. He said he had returned to Washington “so that history will record that not everyone gave in to the massive debt Congress is creating.”
House Republicans were expected to force a roll-call vote that would summon members back to Washington to vote on the package, which is expected to come as early as Thursday morning.
“We are asking every member to return who can return, and we hope that is a large number,” Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said on Tuesday.
But the vote might be the last one for some time under which a majority of the House would have to be physically present. Democratic leaders were expected to move this week to change the rules to allow lawmakers to vote remotely by proxy, a historic step that would reduce the number of representatives who would need to return to Washington during the pandemic.
In contrast, Mr. McConnell predicted that the Senate would not try to approve another legislative response to the pandemic without all 100 senators back in Washington and negotiating in person.
“We ought to bring everyone back and have full participation, begin to think about the implications to the country’s future with this level of national debt,” he said at a news conference.
While negotiators agreed to increase the administration’s original request, it was unclear how long the new funds could sustain the program, which had a rocky rollout that stretched the capacity of the Small Business Administration, the small federal agency overseeing it.
It took only 13 days to exhaust the original tranche of $349 billion, which covered more than 1.6 million loans from nearly 5,000 lenders — more than 14 years’ worth of loans typically processed by the agency. And the program has been criticized for failing to reach the businesses that needed it most, after it emerged that large restaurant chains had gotten money while many smaller companies were unable to.
Congress is likely to face calls to expand the program further, increasing the range of small businesses that could receive loans, and to provide still more funding.
White House officials acknowledged that they would soon be back at the table for new talks.
“We’ve got to get through this stimulus, and then it’s on to the next stimulus,” Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, told reporters.
Mr. Schumer, Mr. Mnuchin, Ms. Pelosi and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, negotiated Monday night and into the wee hours of Tuesday morning in an effort to resolve an impasse over Democrats’ demands for a national testing strategy, as well as their call for more money for state and local governments.
The two Democratic leaders vowed to continue pushing for the additional funds in future measures, as well as hazard pay for front-line workers, worker protections, election security funds and food assistance. Republicans have so far resisted the inclusion of most of those provisions in the four packages that have now passed through the Senate.
“I’m not doing anything that’s non-coronavirus related,” Mr. McConnell said in the interview, though he acknowledged that efforts to supply more funding to state and local governments would prompt “a big debate, and we’ll do it when we’re all back here together.”
The National Governors Association continued to call for a half-trillion dollars to help counter budgetary shortfalls, as well as other investments to support states, and Mr. Cuomo was particularly scathing about the measure.
“I think it’s a terrible mistake not to provide money for the states,” he said in Buffalo before traveling to Washington to meet with Mr. Trump. “I get small businesses, I get airlines. How about police? How about fire? How about health care workers? How about teachers? We’re not going to fund schools? I don’t get it.”
The measure would steer $11 billion of the money for testing to states, and mandate that states, localities, territories and tribes also create their own plans for testing and mitigation.
It would also provide more money to the federal government for testing, including $1 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, $1.8 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $1 billion for testing those without health insurance, and $22 million for the Food and Drug Administration. There would also be $1 billion allocated for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and $825 million for community health centers, rural health centers and other health institutions.
And it would set aside $6 million for the Department of Health Human Services inspector general to conduct oversight.",politicsNews,4/21/2020,New York Times
The Quiet Hand of Conservative Groups in the Anti-Lockdown Protests,"Groups in a loose coalition have tapped their networks to drive up turnout at recent rallies in state capitals and financed lawsuits, polling and research to combat the stay-at-home orders.
WASHINGTON — An informal coalition of influential conservative leaders and groups, some with close connections to the White House, has been quietly working to nurture protests and apply political and legal pressure to overturn state and local orders intended to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
The groups have tapped their networks to drive up turnout at recent rallies in state capitals, dispatched their lawyers to file lawsuits, and paid for polling and research to undercut the arguments behind restrictions that have closed businesses and limited the movement of most Americans.
Among those fighting the orders are FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots, which played pivotal roles in the beginning of Tea Party protests starting more than a decade ago. Also involved are a law firm led partly by former Trump White House officials, a network of state-based conservative policy groups, and an ad hoc coalition of conservative leaders known as Save Our Country that has advised the White House on strategies for a tiered reopening of the economy.
The effort picked up some influential support on Tuesday, when Attorney General William P. Barr expressed concerns about state-level restrictions potentially infringing on constitutional rights, and suggested that, if that occurred, the Justice Department might  weigh in, including by supporting legal challenges by others. Separately, in Wisconsin, Republicans in the state legislature sued to block the Democratic governor’s order extending stay-at-home rules through May 26.
Those helping orchestrate the fight against restrictions predict the effort could energize the right in the same way the Tea Party movement did in 2009 and 2010, and potentially be helpful to President Trump as he campaigns for re-election. But the cause has yet to demonstrate that kind of traction.
Polls show a majority of Americans are more concerned about reopening the country too quickly than they are about the damage to the economy. And coronavirus protests have drawn smaller crowds ranging from a few dozen to several thousand at a rally in Michigan last week.
Conditions are hardly ideal for a protest movement related to the virus. In addition to the health risks, demonstrators potentially face legal exposure for violating the very measures they are protesting. Plus, some key Republican leaders have embraced the types of restrictions being targeted, while powerful grass-roots mobilizing groups, including those spearheaded by the billionaire activist Charles Koch, have so far not embraced the protests.
Still, the fight has emerged as a galvanizing cause for a vocal element of Mr. Trump’s base and others on the political right. Organizers see it as unifying social conservatives, who view the orders as targeting religious groups; fiscal conservatives who chafe at the economic devastation wrought by the restrictions on businesses; and civil libertarians who contend that the restrictions infringe on constitutional rights.
“Groups are united in purpose on this,” said Noah Wall, advocacy director for FreedomWorks, which in 2009 organized a Tea Party protest that drew tens of thousands of people or more to Washington. He described the current efforts as appealing to a “much broader” group. “This is about people who want to get back to work and leave their homes,” he said.
More than 10 protests are planned for this week, Mr. Wall said, adding that elected officials “are going to see a lot of angry activists, and I think that could change minds.”
The protests mostly appear to have been organized by local residents, and are framed primarily as pushback against what they view as government overreach. But some rallies have prominently featured iconography boosting Mr. Trump and Republicans and denouncing Democrats, as well the occasional Confederate flag and signs promoting conspiracy theories.
As was the case with the Tea Party movement, established national groups that generally align with the Republican Party have sought to fuel the protests, harnessing their energy in a manner that can increase their profiles and build their membership base and donor rolls.
Nonprofit groups including FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots have used their social media accounts and text and email lists to spread the word about protests across the country.
Most of FreedomWorks’s 40 employees are working remotely on the effort, helping to connect local protesters and set up websites for them. The group is considering paid digital advertising to further increase turnout, and has been conducting weekly tracking polls in swing suburban districts that it says show support for reopening parts of country. It is sharing the data with advisers on the president’s economic task force and other conservative allies on Capitol Hill.
While social media has been a key platform for organizing the protests, those efforts have drawn scrutiny. Facebook removed some posts devoted to the protests on Monday for encouraging violations of social distancing laws. And similarities in online organizing efforts behind different protests have sparked accusations that they are not, in fact, organic grass-roots campaigns, but “astroturfing” efforts that are manipulated by Washington conservatives to appear locally driven.
Organizers of recent protests in Oklahoma acknowledged that FreedomWorks helped arrange the events and said they hoped the “rolling protests,” which were intended to keep people in their vehicles, helped Mr. Trump politically. But they stressed that the events reflected real concerns from real people about the economic damage inflicted by mitigation measures.
Carol Hefner, an Oklahoma co-chair of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign who helped organize a protest last week in Oklahoma City, cited the state’s flat terrain as a factor in any decision to ease restrictions. “We have a lot of wind and the wind has pretty much helped us here,” she said. “We are in a much better position than many of the other states to go ahead and open back up.”
Ronda Vuillemont-Smith, an Oklahoma HVAC contractor who helped with the capital rally and another one on Monday in Tulsa, said she encouraged protesters to remain in their vehicles. But Ms. Vuillemont-Smith, who serves on FreedomWorks’s activist advisory council, added, “I see absolutely no risks whatsoever” for open-air protests. “We are adults. We assume personal responsibility for the decisions that we make,” she said.
The Oklahoma organizers and Mr. Wall, as well as the White House and the Trump campaign, said there was no coordination between the protests and Mr. Trump’s team.
But the protests coincide with messages from Mr. Trump, and have been helped and organized by his supporters, some of whom have begun new ventures to advance the cause.
One of them is Reopen America Political Action Committee, which aims to bring small business owners to Washington to lobby lawmakers to reopen, starting with a 24-hour rally at the White House on May 1 — the target Mr. Trump set for reopening.
The group, which was created this month, has yet to report any financial activity. But its founder, Suzzanne Monk, who is active on Twitter with the handle @Trumpertarian, called the idea for the rally “pushback against these governors who want to stay shut down far beyond their economic capacity to do so.”
Support for the protests features more direct ties to the White House than simply support for Mr. Trump. The administration recently formed an advisory group for reopening the economy that included Stephen Moore, the conservative economics commentator. Mr. Moore had been coordinating with FreedomWorks, the Tea Party Patriots and the American Legislative Exchange Council in a coalition called “Save Our Country,” which was formed to push for a quicker easing of restrictions.
At the same time, Mr. Moore was communicating with a group of local activists in Wisconsin involved in organizing a protest at the State Capitol set for Friday. On a conservative YouTube program that went online the day Mr. Trump named him to the task force, Mr. Moore said he had “one big donor in Wisconsin” who had pledged financial support for the protesters, telling him, “‘Steve, I promise, I will pay the bail and legal fees of anyone who gets arrested.’”
In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Moore declined to identify the donor, but said, “I do think you’re going to see these start to erupt.”
He said he would probably turn down an invitation to speak at the protest in Wisconsin, because “it’s important that no one be under the impression that it’s sponsored or directed by national groups in Washington.”
A legal offensive against the restrictions is also being waged by groups and individuals supportive of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Barr’s comments on Tuesday came a few days after a letter sent by groups including FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List urging the Justice Department to consider intervening to block restrictions that the officials said were unconstitutional infringements on civil liberties.
Lawyers aligned with socially conservative causes have filed their own lawsuits against governors.
Many are focused on allowing smaller churches to keep holding services, but the objections cover a range of other activities. In Michigan, a lawsuit is challenging provisions of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order banning travel to vacation homes and gatherings of non-household members.
A law firm that advises the Trump Organization, Michael Best & Friedrich, is representing members of a new protest group in North Carolina called ReOpenNC. Michael Best’s ranks include the former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus, the former deputy White House counsel Stefan C. Passantino and the current senior counsel at the Trump campaign, Justin Clark.
ReOpenNC had told its members that a “generous donor” had arranged to pay for buses to bring protesters to Raleigh from around the state. But, in a sign of how loath the groups are to be viewed as “astroturf” creations, the group said it had scrapped the plan when a news station, WRAL, asked about it. (Afterward, a former defense contractor and perennial North Carolina political candidate, Tim D’Annunzio, stepped forward on Facebook to say he was the donor and was still hoping to run the buses.)
On Friday, Anthony J. Biller, a Raleigh-based lawyer with Michael Best, wrote to Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, on behalf of a ReOpenNC co-founder, Kristen Elizabeth, and a member who was arrested at a protest last week, seeking dismissal of the charges. In an interview, Mr. Biller said he hoped the state would agree to allow ReOpenNC to demonstrate safely without fear of arrest, adding, “What is sufficient safety to buy toilet paper at Costco should be sufficient safety to practice one’s fundamental rights, particularly about these issues.”
He said that he was working pro bono but that there was “no coordination with the Trump administration, as some bozos have implied.”
One force in conservative politics that has kept its distance from the stay-at-home protests is the network of groups backed by the billionaire Mr. Koch. The largest Koch-backed group, Americans for Prosperity, which played a leading role in facilitating the Tea Party movement, has remained on the sidelines of the coronavirus protests.
GoDaddy records show that a public relations firm tied to the Koch network, In Pursuit Of LLC, registered the domain name “reopenmississippi.com.” An official said the group had planned to use the site to highlight a nuanced approach being developed by the network to reopen the economy while balancing health concerns.
“The question is — what is the best way to get people back to work?” said Emily Seidel, the chief executive of Americans for Prosperity. “We don’t see protests as the best way to do that,” she said, adding that “the choice between full shutdown and immediately opening everything is a false choice.”",politicsNews,4/21/2020,New York Times
Trump’s Scientists Push Back on His Claim That Virus May Not Return This Fall,"The president has continued to broadcast his personal hopes for the coronavirus, questioning its ability to last into the fall and winter.
WASHINGTON — In February, President Trump told the public that the coronavirus should “go away” by April. In March, he said that the virus may “wash” away by summer. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the American public that the virus “won’t be coming back in the form that it was” this fall or winter. He then mused that it might not come back at all.
The scientists flanking him at a White House briefing explicitly said otherwise.
“There will be coronavirus in the fall,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, said as Mr. Trump looked on.
More than 40,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the outbreak is still well underway. But in his public remarks, Mr. Trump has continued to broadcast his personal hopes for the virus, questioning its ability to last into the fall and winter.
“If we have embers of corona coupled with the flu,” Mr. Trump said, “it’s not going to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape or form,” after saying, “It’s also possible it doesn’t come back at all.”
The president’s latest assertion seemed prompted by his anger with The Washington Post over an interview with Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published a day earlier. In that interview, Dr. Redfield warned that fall and winter would be taxing on Americans because influenza and the coronavirus would be circulating at the same time.
“He was misquoted,” Mr. Trump said.
“His whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot so that next fall we don’t have such a big season of flu,” the president continued.
But when pressed by reporters, Dr. Redfield said he had been accurately quoted. “There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” he said in that interview.
On Wednesday, directed by the president to take the stage, Dr. Redfield said, “When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time.”
He added: “I didn’t say that this was going to be worse. I said that this was going to be more difficult.” Taking the lectern to quibble with reporters over the article — which had the headline “C.D.C. Director Warns Second Wave of Coronavirus Is Likely to Be Even More Devastating” — Mr. Trump said that Dr. Redfield did not actually know if “the corona” would come back, and that he had spoken to the doctor at “great length” about his comments.
Asked how he could repeatedly assert that the coronavirus would come back in pockets or not at all by the winter, Mr. Trump said multiple times that there was reason to believe it might not. Health experts — including Dr. Redfield — have stressed that Americans need to be prepared either way.
“If it does come back, it’s not going to come back, and I’ve spoken to 10 different people, it’s not going to be like it was,” the president said, citing improved containment and mitigation efforts.
When pressed by reporters, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, did not directly support the president’s assertion. But Dr. Fauci, another leading scientific voice for the administration, supported Dr. Redfield’s assertion that the virus would be here in the fall.
“What Dr. Redfield was saying, first of all, is that we will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that,” he said, adding: “It’s going to be complicated. So whether or not it’s going to be big or small is going to depend on our response.”
The president has on multiple occasions suggested that the pandemic would ease off in the summer, despite research showing otherwise. Several small studies have indicated that while warmer temperatures might make it harder for the coronavirus to survive in the air or on surfaces for long periods of time, it could still be contagious for hours, if not days.
Cases have also continued to explode in countries with equatorial climates and those in the Southern Hemisphere, which is currently in the middle of summer.",politicsNews,4/22/2020,New York Times
"Excluded From Bailouts, Mortgage Servicers Face Cash Crunch","Lawmakers and lobbyists warn that missed house payments could leave servicers insolvent but federal officials are not sold on the need for a rescue.
WASHINGTON — Federal policymakers have rushed to backstop nearly every corner of the financial system as the coronavirus exacts a bruising toll on the U.S. economy. But there is growing concern that a critical corner of the housing industry has been overlooked, putting mortgage companies in a precarious position as millions of borrowers delay payments.
The strain is expected to intensify in the coming weeks, as businesses shed millions of workers who will have little choice but to seek a hardship payment waiver or forbearance from their lenders. That could put a large swath of the mortgage industry in jeopardy, with firms that are not banks but make loans and collect payments facing a severe cash crunch and potential insolvency.
Lawmakers in both parties have begun warning about a looming crisis and are urging the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to take swift action. This month, a bipartisan group of senators warned Mr. Mnuchin that $100 billion of mortgage payments could be delayed this year and that standalone mortgage servicers, whose annual net profits they estimated amounted to less than $10 billion combined, could become insolvent. House Democrats have echoed those concerns.
“Mortgage servicers are expected to face increased strain as millions of homeowners and renters lose jobs, are furloughed, or see reduced hours, all of which will keep them from making mortgage and rent payments, as a result of this public health crisis,” Representative Maxine Waters, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter this week.
Yet there is little agreement among policymakers about what, if anything, the government should do to help these firms. Mr. Mnuchin, along with Mark Calabria, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have played down the risks to this industry. The Fed has been clear that it is watching, but has yet to signal that it is ready to step in.
As a result, a game of chicken has ensued between federal regulators and dozens of mortgage firms that are not affiliated with any bank but play a big role in keeping the $11 trillion residential mortgage market humming.
These firms, which both originate mortgages and collect loan payments, have grown after the 2008 housing crisis, as big banks backed away from what was perceived as a risky and expensive business. Today, nonbank mortgage firms, such as Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage and Mr. Cooper (formerly Nationstar), account for nearly 60 percent of all mortgages issued in the United States and service over half of the nation’s outstanding mortgages.
It is a cash-intensive business: The servicers collect payments from mortgage borrowers and then funnel it back to the investors who own the bonds backed by those loans. When borrowers are given forbearance and allowed to stop making mortgage payments, the servicer has less cash coming in the door. Yet it is still obligated to make payouts to investors, along with paying property taxes and insurance bills on behalf of property owners. And unlike banks, these firms are not required to have large financial cushions that would allow them to withstand losses.
Nearly three million homeowners have already sought forbearance, according to the real estate data firm Black Knight, meaning that 5.5 percent of all mortgage holders asked to delay their monthly payments. The industry expects those numbers to jump in the coming months, especially if unemployment continues to soar as many economists expect.
The result could be a cash crisis in May, as many of those principal and interest payments to bond investors come due.
“I do think there are going to be financial problems coming because mortgage servicers are going to have trouble, big time,” said Barry Eichengreen, a University of California, Berkeley, economist who is a scholar of the Great Depression.
Policymakers have taken significant steps to insulate the financial system and individuals against economic pain, including placing restrictions on foreclosures. A law passed last month allows borrowers with federally backed mortgages — covering the overwhelming majority of home loans — to seek forbearance without penalty for up to a year if they are experiencing financial hardship from the virus.
But so far the government has not devised a plan to ensure the financial stability of mortgage servicers. The companies and their lobbyists want a federal lifeline.
“They mandated forbearance,” said Michael Bright, chief executive of the Structured Finance Association, a trade group that supports investors in securitized mortgages and other loans. “It would be like telling restaurants they had to prepare food for the unemployed but not paying the restaurants to do so.”
The Mortgage Bankers Association has been lobbying for a lending facility.
“What we really want is a statement from the Fed and Treasury that they will create such a facility and it will take time to work out operational details but it will be in place when it’s needed,” said Robert D. Broeksmit, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The risk for servicers has been well-known among regulators, who have routinely cited their shaky business models yet done little to address the vulnerabilities.
As recently as December, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, headed by Mr. Mnuchin, warned in its annual report that nonbank mortgage companies “could transmit risk to the financial system should they experience financial stress.”
“The largest nonbank servicers have limited liquidity, often just enough cash and securities held for sale to cover a few months of operating and interest expenses.”
Some housing regulators began expressing concern in 2016 that nonbank mortgage firms operated with less regulatory oversight than banks and might not be financially equipped to withstand an economic crisis. One regulator, the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, took some steps last year to require nonbank mortgage firms to increase their capital levels and undergo stress tests.
Ginnie Mae is an important regulator in the housing market, as it guarantees payments to bond investors on mortgages written by many nonbank firms. Recently, Ginnie Mae took its own steps to quiet concern in the mortgage market by saying it would set up a financing vehicle to provide cash advances to mortgage-servicing firms.
But the industry is looking for even broader relief and pressure has been mounting on Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Calabria, whose agency oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two giant government-controlled mortgage finance firms.
Mr. Calabria said he was not ready to embrace the “apocalyptic” predictions of mortgage servicers and industry lobbyists.
He said he had seen some “insane numbers” predicting that mortgage servicers would need tens of billions of dollars in financial help and said he was skeptical that so many homeowners would seek mortgage relief. Many people are still working from home, he said, and he anticipates some parts of the economy will start to reopen this summer.
“Our expectation is the overwhelming majority of people who take forbearance will be for two or three months and not 12 months,” he said.
Mr. Calabria set off widespread concern in the mortgage industry two weeks ago, when he said he did not see the need for Fannie and Freddie to provide additional financial support to mortgage servicing firms, and in particular nonbank servicers.
He said his job is to make sure Fannie and Freddie — which were placed into a government conservatorship at the start of the last financial crisis — have enough money to avoid financial trouble this time around. Mr. Calabria also said he did not believe the collapse of any one mortgage servicer would pose a systemic risk to the financial system.
Mr. Mnuchin, who recently set up a task force on nonbank mortgage liquidity, has tried to allay fears that the United States will leave servicers to fend for themselves.
“We’re going to make sure that the market functions properly,” he said at a White House briefing last week.
Fed officials, who have taken other steps to ease strain in the mortgage market, have indicated a willingness to consider a mortgage servicer facility. But the institution may be unwilling to put one in place when housing authorities do not want it.
“We’re watching carefully the situation with mortgage servicers,” Mr. Powell said at the Brookings Institution on April 9. Mortgages are a “key market” that supports households and consumer spending, he said.
If the Fed does do more, it would most likely stem from the $454 billion that Congress gave the Fed and Treasury to stand up emergency lending programs. The Fed has earmarked about 40 percent of those funds for lending and bond-buying that will benefit companies and state and local governments, but has been clear that more could come.
But a bailout for the mortgage industry would most likely fuel calls for more regulation.
“Policymakers were well aware heading into this crisis that these firms were vulnerable to shocks, but didn’t do anything to improve their resiliency,” said Gregg Gelzinis, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. “We should only bail them out if we simultaneously institute a more stringent regulatory framework for them going forward.”",politicsNews,4/20/2020,New York Times
"Frustrated by Lack of Coronavirus Tests, Maryland Got 500,000 From South Korea","Facing shortages, Gov. Larry Hogan and his wife, Yumi Hogan, negotiated with suppliers in South Korea to obtain the kits. “It should not have been this difficult,” he said.
When President Trump told governors that they needed to step up their efforts to secure medical supplies, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland took the entreaty seriously and negotiated with suppliers in South Korea to obtain coronavirus test kits.
“The No. 1 problem facing us is lack of testing,” said Mr. Hogan, a Republican, who has been among the many critics of the Trump administration’s repeated claims that states have adequate testing provided by the federal government. “We can’t open up our states without ramping up testing.”
In recent days, his wife, Yumi Hogan, a Korean immigrant who speaks fluent Korean, had been on the phone in the middle of the night helping to secure the final deal with two labs to sell Maryland the tests.
“Luckily we had a very strong relationship with Korea,” Mr. Hogan said. “But it should not have been this difficult.”
On Saturday, a Korean Air flight arrived at Baltimore-Washington International Airport carrying 5,000 test kits, which officials said would give the state the ability to make 500,000 new tests. The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies gave their seal of approval for the kits as the plane was landing.
“I was frosted because my team was saying that the F.D.A. approval was going to hold it up,” Mr. Hogan said in a telephone interview. “I didn’t care and was going to get the tests anyway.”
So far, Maryland has conducted 71,577 tests for the virus, and nearly 14,000 infections have been recorded, a number that continues to rise. More than 500 people have died in the state.
A number of South Korean vendors were considered for the new test kits, and ultimately the state went with LabGenomics.
Mr. Hogan, Ms. Hogan and a group of state officials greeted the flight to receive the kits on Saturday. The new tests, once they have passed muster in two local labs, will be distributed to the testing centers the state has set up in sporting fields, repurposed vehicle emissions testing centers and other locations.
“We want to get to the point where we can test as many people as possible,” Mr. Hogan said, noting that the state, like most others, has been limited to testing only the very sick and emergency and health care workers.
Expanded testing capacity will go to high-priority areas, such as nursing and group homes, expanded drive-through sites, primary care practices and urgent care centers.
Other states, desperate for things like personal protective equipment and other medical gears, have moved to acquire it, often stealthily, from other nations.
On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence said there was “a sufficient capacity of testing across the country today for any state in America” to help the nation emerge from the coronavirus shutdown, something that Mr. Hogan and other governors from both parties disputed.",politicsNews,4/20/2020,New York Times
White House and Democrats Near Deal on Aid for Small Businesses,"The $450 billion agreement would also include more money for hospitals and coronavirus testing, which Democrats had insisted on.
 
WASHINGTON — The White House and congressional Democrats on Sunday closed in on an agreement for a $450 billion economic relief package to replenish a depleted emergency fund for small businesses and to expand coronavirus testing around the country, with votes on the measure possible early this week.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described the broad outlines of the package in an appearance on CNN on Sunday. The agreement would include $300 billion to replenish the emergency fund, called the Paycheck Protection Program; $50 billion for the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief fund; $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in separate television appearances Sunday morning that a deal appeared to be in the offing.
“We’ve made very good progress, and I’m very hopeful we could come to an agreement tonight or early tomorrow morning,” Mr. Schumer said, appearing shortly after Mr. Mnuchin on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He said the White House was “going along with” some of the Democrats’ requests, “so we feel pretty good.”
Mr. Mnuchin said President Trump approved of the framework, and the president himself expressed optimism on Sunday night about an agreement. “We are very close to a deal,” Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Mnuchin said he hoped that the Senate could vote on the bill as early as Monday and the House on Tuesday.
That would represent a significant breakthrough after nearly two weeks of stalemate over the bill, even as the $349 billion small-business fund ran dry Thursday with many applicants still in line, a move that risked adding more bankruptcies, business failures and job losses to an already stunning economic toll.
That timeline, however, could be optimistic, and the path ahead is complicated. With lawmakers scattered across the country, many in states that are restricting travel, House and Senate leaders will most likely try to approve any agreement during procedural sessions this week as opposed to bringing their rank and file back to the Capitol to vote. But during procedural sessions, any one lawmaker could object, delaying final passage.
The money for hospitals and testing in the package Mr. Mnuchin outlined was a significant concession to Democrats, who were standing in the way of a quick and stand-alone infusion of cash to the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers forgivable loans to small businesses to create incentives for them to keep employees on their payroll.
Democrats had also wanted to couple an infusion for the small-business program with more money for states and cities. But Mr. Mnuchin said such funds would be included in a future relief package.
Later on Sunday, Senators Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, and Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, announced what they described as “a major bipartisan breakthrough” to deliver funds to states and communities on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.
Their proposal would make counties and towns with 50,000 or more people eligible for federal dollars; the current population threshold is 500,000. The senators said they would introduce the plan when the Senate convened.
“Senator Menendez’s state and mine were hit hard by the Covid-19 epidemic,” Dr. Cassidy, a gastroenterologist, said in a statement, adding that the two “worked hard to make sure state and local governments can maintain essential services necessary for employees and employers to survive.”
That bipartisan effort stood in stark contrast to the partisan warfare that has enveloped the talks over the small-business aid since the start. On Sunday, Mr. Trump attacked Ms. Pelosi on Twitter as “an inherently ‘dumb’ person” and predicted that she would be “overthrown” as speaker, “either by inside or out.”
That capped a week that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill spent trading barbs. Republicans, who argued that there was no need to add money for hospitals and testing when it had not yet run out, accused Democrats of holding small businesses hostage while unemployment numbers soared.
“I cannot understand after watching another five million get unemployed how Speaker Pelosi continues to say no,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, said Thursday morning on a conference call with reporters.
Republicans have also expressed strong opposition to adding money for states and municipalities, saying Democrats have pushed for unrestricted funds, not related to the coronavirus, that would effectively subsidize bad fiscal decisions that occurred before the pandemic. That has been a red line for Republicans throughout the talks.
But after the funding for the Paycheck Protection Program lapsed, Republicans expressed the first hints of openness to accepting at least some of the Democrats’ demands. In an interview with Politico on Friday, Mr. McCarthy said he was “fine with doing some hospital” funding as part of a package to shore up the program.
Some Republicans, though, have expressed skepticism about Mr. Mnuchin, whom they see as accommodating to Democrats. Asked on Thursday about how a deal that included hospital money would be received, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, remained noncommittal, saying only, “We’d take a look at it.”
Mr. Mnuchin also said on Sunday that he was hopeful that the economy could rebound in a matter of months rather than years. He said that he hoped the extraordinary efforts the government had taken to encourage businesses to keep workers on their payrolls would prevent the jobless rate from reaching 20 percent.
Mr. McConnell hosted a call on Sunday with Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump, Republican senators and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, about the ongoing negotiations. Mr. McConnell said that additional funds for state and local governments, as well as more money for food assistance, would not be included in the final package, according to an aide for a Republican leader who requested anonymity to disclose details of a private phone call.
Mr. Mnuchin added that some of the unresolved items were related to funding for testing, and that he would be conferring with Mr. McConnell, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, to resolve the issues to ensure swift passage.
Democrats are calling the current package Stimulus 3.5, in reference to the three bills that came before it. In the House, Ms. Pelosi and her committee leaders are already working on elements of a fourth package, though it is unclear what that will look like.
Once negotiations on the current bill draw to a close, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell will have to figure out a schedule for voting. One possibility is that the measure could be approved by voice vote, which would spare members the necessity of returning to the Capitol.
But a single lawmaker could stand in the way of such a maneuver, which is what happened last month when the House took up the $2 trillion stimulus package that created the paycheck program. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, thwarted the effort by demanding a quorum and insisting his colleagues show up in person.
Anticipating a repeat of that episode, Ms. Pelosi said last week that she would back a system of remote voting by proxy — a major shift for the speaker, and one that would break with centuries of tradition of voting in person. To do so would require a change in House rules, which itself would require an in-person vote.
Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Rules Committee, who has been deputized by Ms. Pelosi to examine alternative methods of voting, proposed the proxy voting plan last week. It would allow lawmakers who could not travel to the Capitol because of the pandemic to give explicit instructions on each vote to a colleague who would be authorized to act on their behalf.
In an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Ms. Pelosi said she wanted to know what Republicans thought before moving ahead with the plan. “We want to keep the faith on both sides,” she said.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Massie said — somewhat surprisingly — that he would not object to forgoing a floor vote on changing rules to permit proxy voting so long as the process was sufficiently “transparent.” Mr. Massie said the rule should require that the names of those who voted in person and who voted by proxy be made public, along with the names of those whom absent lawmakers had authorized to vote on their behalf.

Surprising Poll Results: People Are Now Happy to Pick Up the Phone,"Pollsters are used to having their calls screened. But when everyone is stuck at home, a stranger with some survey questions can be a lifeline.
It was a straightforward telephone survey of New Yorkers, a series of questions about the effects of the coronavirus crisis, and it was meant to take just a few minutes. But a strange thing kept happening. Many of the people who answered the phone wanted to keep talking — about their loneliness, about their sadness, about their fears for the future — even after the questions had stopped.
“People are dealing with anxiety, and they haven’t seen their family and friends,” said Ayala Mitchell, one of the interviewers for the survey conducted earlier this month by the Siena College Research Institute. “They just want to talk to someone.”
The one that really got to her, Ms. Mitchell said, was her conversation with an older woman who said the only good thing about her day had been venturing outside and seeing a single flower blooming. It was hard not to cry, Ms. Mitchell said. “You have to be very careful because you don’t want to come across as biased, but I said, ‘I understand how you’re feeling. We all have to get through this.’”
As the coronavirus has swept across the country, it has stolen millions of jobs and thrust people everywhere into acute financial insecurity. It has also forced the majority of the population to shelter in place. But in an industry where rejection is a normal part of a day’s work pollsters are finding that many people are suddenly willing, even grateful, to talk. In some cases they are treating the anonymous questioners as lifelines to the world, almost as therapists, in the absence of other people to talk to.
Executives at a number of firms across the country said in interviews that not only are more people willing to answer the phone to unknown callers these days, but that those who do agree to be interviewed are more likely to stay through the end of the conversation. This has led to an increase in productivity rates of roughly 25 percent, they said — and to an unusual situation where some respondents actually thank the pollsters for getting in touch.
It also means that, in a moment of crisis and in the midst of a presidential election, a wider variety of people are willing to tell pollsters what they think, so it’s more likely that a poll’s respondents will come closer to reflecting the makeup of the general population.
Even in online surveys, pollsters have also seen an increase in participation over the past few weeks. At the Pew Research Center, which does most of its polling through the online American Trends Panel, many respondents filled in a voluntary-comments box in a recent survey with expressions of gratitude.
“There were a lot of people volunteering that they appreciated being asked about this content, that they felt it was timely, they felt it was relevant, and really appreciated the opportunity to talk about this,” Courtney Kennedy, Pew’s director of survey research, said of the firm’s recent virus-related poll. “We don’t usually get that kind of feedback.”
Don Levy, director of polling at Siena, said that respondents’ desire for human connections was understandable, but that it also complicated pollsters’ job. For survey results to be considered reliable, pollsters must use a series of specific questions, with interviewers adhering closely to a script so as not to influence the responses. Even expressing agreement can potentially bias a respondent’s later answers, experts agree.
Siena’s recent poll of New Yorkers about the coronavirus was designed to take about 10 minutes but “averaged about 14 minutes — which is a big difference,” Mr. Levy said. (Siena often conducts polls in partnership with The New York Times and other organizations. It also fields its own surveys, like this one.)
LaShawn Nelson, who conducted interviews for that poll from her home in Houston, said it was challenging to stick to the script when confronted with so much anxiety and worry at the other end of the line. One woman, she said, told her she’d lost her job and then began to weep, right there on the phone. “When they say what they’re going through and we just move on to the next question, it seems like we’re not even human, like we don’t care,” Ms. Nelson said. “But we do care.”
“I tell them, ‘Just be patient — I know everything seems like it’s not going to end, but hold on, things will turn around and the economy will pick up again,’” she said.
Response rates have even risen among people in typically tough-to-reach demographics, such as young people and those without college degrees, who are typically less likely to use landlines. Pollsters have reported an increase in participation among cellphone users — particularly in the daytime, when in the past many respondents would most likely have been at work and unwilling to answer a call from an unknown number.
“The gaps you’re used to seeing in terms of age or education didn’t exist as much” in recent polls, said Eran Ben-Porath, executive vice president of the research firm SSRS, which conducts polls on behalf of news organizations such as CNN.
The increase in responses means that survey results are likely a more precise reflection of how people feel. When certain groups respond in lower numbers, pollsters have to add more weight to the few responses they did get from those groups. As response rates rise among harder-to-reach demographics, the data is less likely to need further adjustments.
Polling also costs less when more people pick up the phone. Most trusted national polls are based on at least 400, and sometimes thousands of interviews. In recent years the response rates to phone polls — reflecting the number of calls it took, on average, to get each completed interview — have often been dismal: around one in 20. For cellphone users, it’s often even lower.
Some firms are finding that their productivity has risen so much they can afford to conduct more polls this spring than expected.
Even telemarketers have found that people are more willing to chat. Paul Stockford, the research director at the National Association of Call Centers, said many telemarketing firms had reported in recent weeks that response rates were up, and that calls were lasting longer. He said that conversations were often taking on a “therapeutic” quality — for both callers and respondents.
The very process of polling has also been altered by the pandemic. Many firms have shut down their call centers and equipped workers to make calls from home. Those who are still operating the centers have reduced their staffing and reconfigured their offices so that interviewers sit farther apart.
Mr. Levy of Siena spent four days in the hospital last month after contracting the virus, and immediately moved his entire staff — analysts as well as interviewers — to work from home. “I haven’t been face-to-face with any of the people I work with for more than a month,” he said.
The virus has become far and away the most prominent issue on Americans’ minds‚ seeping into politics, daily life, work and the national psyche. So at Pew, Ms. Kennedy and her team decided to bring their eight different policy groups together to work collectively on virus-related polling.
“Normally it works well for those teams to cover their own thing, and there’s not a tremendous amount of overlap, but we’re recognizing that this is completely different,” Ms. Kennedy said. “This one national story of coronavirus is affecting all of these different dimensions of people’s lives at the same time, and there’s tremendous interplay between how your economic situation is affecting your mental health, and it’s affecting your kids, and your marriage.”
Lee Miringoff, who runs the Marist College poll, said he has been reminded of a different experience, 19 years ago, when Marist surveyed New Yorkers just days after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. At first, he had worried that respondents might be offended at receiving a call from a polling company in a time of national mourning. Instead, he said, “people were very, very happy to connect.”
“We wanted not to be annoying to anybody or upsetting,” Mr. Miringoff said. “We found exactly what people are finding out right now: that the response rates were off the charts, people had a lot to say, and they wanted to share.”
Ms. Mitchell, one of the Siena interviewers, said that some of her conversations with New Yorkers about the coronavirus had been particularly wrenching, like the one she had with a 92-year-old widow who lived alone and had no family to check on her. “It was so sad and I thought, ‘Oh God, I wish I could call her,’” Ms. Mitchell said.
“When you’re talking to these people every day and you hear their stories, you can’t help but get emotional,” said Ms. Mitchell, who herself is holed up in Houston with her two sons, both currently home from college, and who also works at a second job, as a claims adjuster for an insurance company. “At the end of the day, I’m grateful that I have a job.”",politicsNews,4/17/2020,New York Times
Black Leaders Want a Black Woman as Biden’s Running Mate. But Who?,"Among black leaders close to Joe Biden, a commitment to selecting a woman is not enough. They have publicly and privately pushed him to select a black woman to fuel black voter enthusiasm.
Four years ago, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey made his vice-presidential pitch to Hillary Clinton at her Washington home, months before she faced Donald J. Trump in the November election.
Mr. Booker, the only African-American to make Mrs. Clinton’s shortlist, argued that the presence of a black running mate would motivate black voters, helping Mrs. Clinton recreate the coalition that backed former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.
But Mrs. Clinton had won the Democratic nomination with substantial black support, and some of her advisers argued that many black voters would already be energized by Mr. Trump’s divisive candidacy and appeals to white conservatives, according to several people involved in the selection. After weighing the strengths and weaknesses of Mr. Booker, among others, she chose Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a white moderate widely seen as a safe, traditional pick.
“Kaine brought good and solid credentials,” said Minyon Moore, a key adviser to Mrs. Clinton who participated in the selection process. “But the difference between a Cory and Tim Kaine could’ve closed the enthusiasm gap. Looking back on it, it’s fair for people to ask if we should’ve factored enthusiasm more into it.”
No two presidential cycles are completely analogous, but as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. begins his search for a running mate, Mrs. Clinton’s loss and the weaker-than-expected black turnout in 2016 are on the minds of top Democrats. Mr. Biden has already committed to selecting a woman, and he and his allies have repeatedly mentioned two black women as possibilities — Senator Kamala Harris of California and Stacey Abrams, the party’s 2018 nominee for governor of Georgia — as well as several white women, particularly Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.
Pressure has been growing on Mr. Biden to choose a black woman to inspire black turnout this fall and not take it for granted. The Rev. Al Sharpton, for instance, who speaks to Mr. Biden regularly, is to announce his support for Ms. Abrams as vice president as soon as next week, according to those familiar with his plans.
Yet Mr. Biden is facing other factors and pressures as well. He has said he wants someone who is prepared to step into the vice presidency immediately, a nod to the value he puts on government and leadership experience. He would be the oldest president ever, 78 on Inauguration Day, and is looking for a partner and, possibly, a potential successor. With the country deep into the coronavirus pandemic, voters will also assess whether his running mate appears capable of handling the worst national crisis since World War II.
Ms. Harris, who has statewide and national experience, is seen in the Biden camp as a more likely pick than Ms. Abrams, who was a state legislative leader for a decade before losing her bid for governor. Still, some Democrats believe that choosing a hands-on governor or veteran senator is a better fit for the crisis than Ms. Harris, who was attorney general of California and has been in the Senate for three years.
Mr. Biden’s selection has also become a vehicle for a broader debate among Democrats about the best strategy to win back the White House. While candidates like Ms. Harris or Ms. Abrams could energize core Democratic constituencies such as black voters or younger voters, as well as women, Ms. Whitmer and Ms. Klobuchar could be a geographic plus, considering they hail from the Upper Midwest region important to the Electoral College.
Among some black leaders and activists close to Mr. Biden, including Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and former Democratic Party chair Donna Brazile, a commitment to selecting a woman is not enough. They have publicly and privately pushed Mr. Biden to select a black woman, arguing black voter enthusiasm may hinge on it. .
“I’m rooting for everybody black,” said Leah Daughtry, the former chief executive of the Democratic National Convention, quoting the actress Issa Rae who used the phrase at the 2017 Emmys.
Mr. Sharpton, the civil rights activist and talk show host, said Mr. Biden “will get the overwhelming majority of the black vote, the question is turnout.”
“Now I’ve told him my preference is for a black woman, but you’ve got to also choose the right black woman,” Mr. Sharpton said in an interview. “In the middle of this pandemic, you have to choose someone that people, and particularly black people, believe can govern from day one.”
Ms. Abrams herself has been outspoken on the issue, taking the unusual route of publicly making the case for why Mr. Biden should choose her. She also said, during an interview this week on ABC’s “The View,” that she would have “concerns” if Mr. Biden didn’t choose a woman of color as his running mate.
“Women of color, particularly black women are the strongest part of the Democratic Party, the most loyal,” she said. “We need a ticket that reflects the diversity of America.”
There is no precedent for the selection of a black running mate. There is also little evidence that vice-presidential selections sway general elections in any meaningful way, including Mrs. Clinton’s selection of Mr. Kaine in 2016. Still, citing the dip in black turnout four years ago, and the importance of black urban centers such as Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Cleveland in the Electoral College, proponents like Mr. Sharpton argue that a black woman could help Mr. Biden.
In 2016, the black voter turnout rate in a presidential election declined for the first time in 20 years, it was seven percentage points lower than the record highs of Mr. Obama’s 2012 re-election. The black share of the electorate also slipped from 13 percent in 2012 to 12 percent in 2016, a difference of 1.5 million black voters, according to Ted Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies how race affects voting behavior.
Aimee Allison, the founder of She The People, a political group aiming to increase participation from all women of color by three to five percentage points in the general election, said a survey of her organization’s members preferred Ms. Abrams, with Ms. Harris coming in second.
“Among black women primary voters, we saw Joe Biden was head and shoulders the pick,” Ms. Allison said. “But what we need to do now is expand across demographics to places where someone like Sanders showed strength — among Latinas in Texas and Nevada, and with Asian-Americans.”
But a preference for Ms. Abrams — or Ms. Harris — is far from a consensus opinion, with the jockeying wrapped up in part in personal histories and Washington power plays.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has encouraged allies to float names of House members like Representatives Val Demings of Florida and Marcia Fudge of Ohio, according to people familiar with those conversations, in part to reward members of her caucus with a higher profile. Several leaders in the Congressional Black Caucus, an organization steeped in tradition, have preferred Ms. Harris, who is a member. Georgia politicians like Atlanta’s former mayor Kasim Reed and its current mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, who endorsed Mr. Biden early and is a top surrogate, are former political rivals of Ms. Abrams.
A recent comment from Mr. Clyburn publicly undercut Ms. Abrams in favor of Ms. Bottoms. Mr. Clyburn, who declined an interview request for this article, said Ms. Abrams lacked sufficient experience.
“There is a young lady right there in Georgia who I think would make a tremendous V.P. candidate, and that’s the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms,” he said in March.
Mr. Biden has been cautious about saying too much about his preferences. He said this week he expected to form a selection panel for his running mate by May 1 and has repeatedly said his top priority is a governing partner he can trust, someone with whom he is “simpatico.”
During an interview with local television in Pittsburgh this week, Mr. Biden said he would choose Michelle Obama as his running mate “in a heartbeat,” but thought she did not want to return to the White House. He largely pivoted away from a question about a black woman serving as his running mate, noting that he had already committed to nominating a black woman for the Supreme Court.
“I’ll commit to that be a woman because it is very important that my administration look like the public, look like the nation,” Mr. Biden said. “There will be a woman of color on the Supreme Court. That doesn’t mean there won’t be a vice president, as well.”
Recent state polls, including in Florida and Michigan, indicate that Mr. Biden begins the general election in a position of relative strength, with stronger support among older voters than Mrs. Clinton had in 2016 exit polls.
Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said that Mr. Biden should make decisions that keep intact his winning primary campaign coalition: ideological moderates, black voters and older voters, among others.
“He had a huge win on Super Tuesday, so what does that tell you about his support and what it’s about?” Ms. Palmieri said. “I would, like, not want to mess with that magic. That’s going to be your ticket into November,” she added, as opposed to “walking away from that and thinking, ‘OK, now we need some other kind of coalition.’”
Some black Democrats said that choosing Ms. Klobuchar or Ms. Whitmer could make political sense. Ms. Moore from the Clinton campaign said Mr. Biden deserved full deference in making his selection, even if she prefers a black woman as his choice. Others cited political liabilities for Ms. Abrams or Ms. Harris, considering Ms. Abrams is untested nationally and Ms. Harris struggled to excite black voters during her 2020 presidential run.
In a national poll of black voters from The Washington Post and Ipsos earlier this year, just over a quarter said that in the event a white candidate won the nomination, it would be important for them to see a black person chosen as the running mate. Seventy-four percent of black Democratic voters said this would not be very important to them.
But Ms. Brazile, who is close to Mr. Biden, offered a warning. Given that several black women are qualified for the role, she said, Mr. Biden risks striking an unintended and problematic note about their fitness to serve if he goes in a different direction.
“Biden has street cred, but at the same time, it’s important to send a message — to send a signal and to brand the Democratic Party as a party of diversity,” she said. “And I think any other message will be read as rejection.”
Ms. Brazile considered her words.
“I know that sounds awful, but it’s true,” she said. “It will be seen as a rejection of viable black women.”",politicsNews,4/24/2020,New York Times
Financial Aid to Struggling States Is Next Big Congressional Battle,"Mitch McConnell said states should file for bankruptcy, but there is broad agreement that Washington will have to bail out local governments suffering economic pain from the coronavirus.
WASHINGTON — With congressional approval of the latest emergency pandemic measure sealed on Thursday, the focus is quickly shifting to an escalating battle over whether Congress will provide hundreds of billions of dollars to states staggering under the costs of the coronavirus outbreak.
Anxious governors on the front lines of battling the pandemic have been clamoring for more federal help, saying their budgets are being stretched to the breaking point and their revenues are collapsing as they pour resources into health care while their economies are shut down. But the latest measure contained no new state aid, as Republicans resisted extending help even as state officials described their situations as increasingly dire.
“Many states are already reporting precipitous declines in revenues that fund state services in health care, education, public safety, transportation and other vital programs,” members of the National Governors Association wrote to congressional leaders this week. “States and local governments need robust support from the federal government as we navigate the response to this pandemic and to help foster the economic recovery that is ahead.”
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, alarmed and angered state officials on Wednesday when he said he wanted to approach the next round of pandemic legislation more deliberately. He said he was opposed to shipping money to state governments if they were going to apply it to fiscal problems unrelated to the pandemic, such as shoring up underfunded pension plans for public workers.
Rather than looking for handouts, Mr. McConnell said states, which shared $150 billion allocated in previous pandemic legislation, should consider filing for bankruptcy. His aides threw fuel on the fire in a news release that said the Senate leader was opposed to “Blue State Bailouts,” suggesting it was Democratic-leaning states that were seeking the money to take care of problems caused by fiscal mismanagement.
Those comments prompted a sharp backlash, including from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, who lashed out at Mr. McConnell for a second day on Thursday.
Mr. Cuomo has consistently said that federal funding was desperately needed to get the state back on its feet and seemed gobsmacked by the concept that it should even consider declaring bankruptcy, noting New York’s position as the nation’s financial services center.
“That’s how you’re going to bring this national economy back?” asked an incredulous Mr. Cuomo, who called Mr. McConnell irresponsible and reckless. “You want to see that market fall through the cellar? Let New York State declare bankruptcy.”
In a virtual interview sponsored by Politico, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican who heads the National Governors Association, said he expected that Mr. McConnell would come to regret his remarks and noted that the Trump administration had been supportive of state assistance.
“I’m hopeful that we are going to, between the administration and the 55 governors in America, including territories, we are going to convince Senator McConnell that maybe he shouldn’t let the states go bankrupt,” said Mr. Hogan, who said his state would soon face a $2.8 billion shortfall.
President Trump gave ambivalent signals at his White House briefing on Thursday, suggesting that he might be open to offering aid to the states, but also saying, “It is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue.” He singled out Illinois, and said many states had been in financial trouble long before “the plague.”
States are facing severe financial strain, as sales tax revenues dry up amid quarantines that have shuttered restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and nail salons. That pain has been compounded by the number of people losing their jobs and filing for state unemployment benefits. Another 4.4 million people filed for unemployment on last week and, while the federal government is kicking in an extra $600 per beneficiary, states must pay the bulk of unemployment benefits using trust funds that are already running low.
“Most state trust funds are underfunded for this crisis,” said Jared Walczak, the director of state tax policy at the Tax Foundation. “It’s hard not to be. The magnitude of this crisis meant that very few states were prepared.”
At least three states — California, New York and Ohio — are expected to deplete their trust funds within two weeks, with Kentucky, Texas and Massachusetts close behind. Once those funds run out, the states can borrow money from the federal government, but must repay it within two years.
Republicans on Capitol Hill say they believe Mr. McConnell, who opposed new state aid in talks that produced the most recent measure, was trying to reassure restive conservatives that he would not give easily on more funding in upcoming talks after Congress has already allocated about $2.7 trillion in deficit spending in response the emergency. But he faces significant obstacles if he intends to block the aid, and most see that as an unlikely outcome given the extent of bipartisan support for more state relief.
Not only do Democrats in the House and the Senate strongly support state aid — it was one concession Democrats were unable to wring out of Republicans in the latest round — but many Republicans have made it clear they do as well.
Several have signed on to bipartisan bills and letters calling for the aid. Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, has joined Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, in drafting legislation providing $500 billion sought by the states.
After Senate approval of the legislation on Tuesday, Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, called for shoring up the states as well.
“I believe we need to do more to help state and local governments affected by this crisis, and I believe the next package should provide additional assistance,” he said, also calling for increased flexibility from the administration on how states can spend the money.
Lawmakers say the latest round of funding could again run out in a matter of days, opening the door to calls for another rescue measure and beginning the struggle over aid to the states in earnest.
While many Republicans back the state relief, top aides said that most would join Mr. McConnell in balking at the idea that it could be applied to a pension bailout and that a compromise could include strict prohibitions on how the money is spent. A top state lawmaker in Illinois last week included a request for $10 billion in pension relief in the state’s appeal for federal help, though the problems long preceded the pandemic.
Many state and municipal pension systems have been underwater since the dot-com crash of 2001, when much of their funding from the booming 1990s melted away. Their problems worsened substantially during the market crash of 2008. Investment losses that year and in 2009 prompted officials in a number of states to attempt pension overhauls in the hope of making their plans sustainable. They were promptly sued by retirees and public workers’ unions, who cited state laws and constitutional provisions that make it illegal to tamper with public pension plans.
The pension problem is not unique to red states or blue. Illinois, a steadfast Democratic stronghold, is seen by experts as the state with the most intractable pension problems. But in Kentucky, Mr. McConnell’s home state, the pension system is in nearly as grave danger as the one in Illinois.",politicsNews,4/23/2020,New York Times
"In Wisconsin, Virus Creates New Front in Long-Simmering Partisan Wars","Protests planned for Friday continue a decade-long partisan cleaving in the state and serve as a stand-in for the general election battle to come.
Wisconsin had barely finished its fight over whether to hold an election in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic before America’s foremost battleground state began another political brawl over the pandemic itself.
Officials from both parties rushed to familiar corners this week, with Democrats rallying behind Gov. Tony Evers’s decision to extend the state’s stay-home ordinance through May 26, while Republicans are stoking anger over what they depict as an assault on civil liberties.
Wisconsin’s decade-long partisan war will once again be on display Friday, as right-wing protesters prepare to mass outside the State Capitol in Madison to assail Mr. Evers and the restrictions he put in place to curb the spread of the virus. Thousands of people have indicated on Facebook that they will attend, making it potentially the largest gathering so far in a nationwide series of protests against stay-at-home restrictions.
Republicans, in need of a show of force after badly losing a State Supreme Court contest this month, have sued Mr. Evers to block the extension, discussed removing his public health secretary and, in recent days, amplified protesters’ calls to reopen the state while covertly helping to coordinate the Madison rally and other satellite gatherings across the state.
The planned protests on Friday, along with smaller events last weekend, have focused attention on the thorny issues governors face as they grapple with the decision over when to ease restrictions, with President Trump alternately encouraging protests calling for states to reopen and warning about the health risks of doing so. And in Wisconsin, a state critical to both Mr. Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the demonstrations serve as a stand-in for the general election battle to come.
“This seems to have become a proxy war for the state Republican Party and it does have a zombie Tea Party feel to it,” said Charlie Sykes, a longtime conservative talk radio host in Milwaukee who left the airwaves at the end of 2016 and has since turned against Trump-era Republicans. “This will energize them to think that they’re back on the offensive. They didn’t miss a beat from losing that Supreme Court election and this all seems about mobilizing and firing up the base.”
The legal challenge to Mr. Evers’s extension follows a similar effort in early April, when Republicans led by Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, successfully petitioned the State Supreme Court to block the governor’s order to move the election date as well as an effort to switch to an all-mail election.
Mr. Vos, in an interview, portrayed the uprising against Mr. Evers as a broad response among Wisconsinites that crossed party lines. “It’s not just Republicans,” he said. “It’s a whole lot of people who own a small businesses and they’re unemployed and there’s no reason they can’t work.”
Vicki McKenna, a conservative talk radio host who has promoted the rallies on her program, said she hoped they inspired county sheriffs and local public health departments to defy the governor’s coronavirus orders.
“You go to central and northern Wisconsin, you have folks who are looking at Milwaukee and saying, ‘We understand that they need help, but why do we have to sacrifice our entire livelihood for them?’” she said.
While deep anger is growing on the right, there is some evidence that the Republican stance on the coronavirus is repelling voters Mr. Trump will need to carry the state in November.
Future Now Fund, a progressive organization that focuses on state legislative races, found in a study that in this month’s State Supreme Court race, Wisconsin counties with higher coronavirus infection rates saw larger shifts to the liberal candidate than did counties with lower rates. The shifts occurred in both urban and rural counties.
“Experiencing coronavirus can push people beyond their tribal lane to a different engagement with politics,” said Daniel Squadron, the co-founder and executive director of Future Now Fund.
And Democrats’ private polling in Wisconsin conducted after the election but before the protests began found 72 percent of Wisconsinites approved of how Mr. Evers has handled the coronavirus response. The same poll found Mr. Trump’s coronavirus job approval in the state was 51 percent.
“They can try to do this ‘We’re going to play to our base’ thing,” said Sachin Chheda, a Milwaukee Democratic operative who ran the Supreme Court campaign for the victorious liberal candidate, Jill Karofsky. “It’s bad politics. They might get some short-term wins, but it isn’t going to help them win in November.”
The organizers of the Madison rally and the two others held last weekend have gone to great lengths to describe themselves and their events as nonpolitical, despite ample evidence that the state’s Republican leadership is intricately involved. They are also trying to prevent the gatherings from becoming a platform for other conservative causes, or from appearing like de facto Trump campaign rallies.
Brian Westrate, the treasurer of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, posted to a private Facebook group for organizers and some attendees of the Madison rally, asking people not to bring emblems of causes other than resisting the stay-at-home order.
“Ok folks, I implore you, please leave Confederate flags and/or AR15s, AK47s, or any other long guns at home,” Mr. Westrate wrote. “I well understand that the Confederacy was more about states rights than slavery. But that does not change the truth of how we should try to control the optics during the event.”
In an interview, Mr. Westrate acknowledged writing the post and said it may be futile to ask the rally participants to limit the variety of their political motivations.
“Ideally, people should leave Trump stuff at home,” he said. “But you can’t hold a rally in favor of the First Amendment and then become over-draconian in terms of telling people how to dress.”
At two rallies last weekend, in the conservative Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield and the rural town of Mosinee, protesters carried Confederate flags, waved Trump signs and toted firearms, according to attendees and news photographs of the gatherings.
Cory Tomczyk, who hosted the Mosinee rally on the grounds of his industrial recycling company — which provides raw materials to companies making paper products — said he hoped the protests  served as a conservative resistance in the same way that the state’s liberals were galvanized by Gov. Scott Walker’s 2011 move to end collective bargaining rights for the state’s public employees.
“People have this image in their head that they’re going to make it look like the protest for Act 10,” Mr. Tomczyk said, referring to the uprising against Mr. Walker’s labor law. “I don’t know if it will look like that, but I hope it will.”
With  Ms. McKenna and others in the state’s powerful network of conservative talk radio hosts promoting the rally daily, the event will likely draw scores of Republican elected officials on hand to lend their support, but perhaps not dominating the stage.
Shae Sortwell, a Republican state representative from Manitowoc County, said his caucus’s G.O.P. leadership suggested members not speak at the rally to try to make sure it comes across as “a citizen-led effort.” Mr. Sortwell said he had no qualms about attending the rally.
“Do we want to take away what people have to live for in the sole pursuit of one singular goal of additional survival,” Mr. Sortwell said. “Is it safe, is it unsafe? I don’t know.”
Adrianne Melby, a social media marketer for a Racine County chiropractic firm who is one of the planners of the Madison rally, said organizers had sought to portray the event as homegrown and apolitical. She said they turned down a donor’s offer to help pay for the event, though Ms. Melby declined to say who made the offer.
Wisconsin’s State Capitol Police on Monday denied the Madison group’s official permit request. Mr. Evers’s spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, said there would not be an effort to stop people from gathering outside the Capitol — they just would not be allowed inside the building.
Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway of Madison said she would not use the city’s police department to force protesters to disperse.
“All indications are that these are manufactured protests,” Ms. Rhodes-Conway said. “They are seeking attention. I think they are getting more attention than they deserve.”
One prominent dissenter among the state’s Republicans is Senator Ron Johnson, who rose from being the chief executive of a plastic manufacturer to winning a Senate seat in the 2010 Tea Party wave. Mr. Johnson said he wouldn’t criticize the governor’s stewardship of the pandemic response, adding that concerns about the economic impact should not lead Wisconsinites to disavow public health guidance.
“I’m not going to gather in crowds,” said Mr. Johnson, who said he is donning a mask when he goes grocery shopping near his home in Oshkosh. “I have enough fear and respect of this illness that I’m not going to do that myself. I’m not encouraging anybody to do it.”
Still, few people wore masks or other protective equipment at the weekend rallies. And Mr. Vos, who wore body-length personal protective equipment during his shift as a poll monitor in his hometown, Burlington, on April 7, declined to say in an interview whether it is safe for thousands of people to gather in protest at the State Capitol.
“I’m not a doctor,” Mr. Vos said. “I don’t give advice to people on how surgery should be done. I think people should make their own choices.”",politicsNews,4/23/2020,New York Times
"Home Alone at the White House: A Sour President, With TV His Constant Companion","As his administration grapples with reopening the economy and responding to the coronavirus crisis, President Trump worries about his re-election and how the news media is portraying him.
WASHINGTON — President Trump arrives in the Oval Office these days as late as noon, when he is usually in a sour mood after his morning marathon of television.
He has been up in the White House master bedroom as early as 5 a.m. watching Fox News, then CNN, with a dollop of MSNBC thrown in for rage viewing. He makes calls with the TV on in the background, his routine since he first arrived at the White House.
But now there are differences.
The president sees few allies no matter which channel he clicks. He is angry even with Fox, an old security blanket, for not portraying him as he would like to be seen. And he makes time to watch Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s briefings from New York, closely monitoring for a sporadic compliment or snipe.
Confined to the White House, the president is isolated from the supporters, visitors, travel and golf that once entertained him, according to more than a dozen administration officials and close advisers who spoke about Mr. Trump’s strange new life. He is tested weekly, as is Vice President Mike Pence, for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The economy — Mr. Trump’s main case for re-election — has imploded. News coverage of his handling of the coronavirus has been overwhelmingly negative as Democrats have condemned him for a lack of empathy, honesty and competence in the face of a pandemic. Even Republicans have criticized Mr. Trump’s briefings as long-winded and his rough handling of critics as unproductive.
His own internal polling shows him sliding in some swing states, a major reason he declared a temporary halt to the issuance of green cards to those outside the United States. The executive order — watered down with loopholes after an uproar from business groups — was aimed at pleasing his political base, people close to him said, and was the kind of move Mr. Trump makes when things feel out of control. Friends who have spoken to him said he seemed unsettled and worried about losing the election.
But the president’s primary focus, advisers said, is assessing how his performance on the virus is measured in the news media, and the extent to which history will blame him.
“He’s frustrated,” said Stephen Moore, an outside economic adviser to Mr. Trump who was the president’s pick to sit on the Federal Reserve Board before his history of sexist comments and lack of child support payments surfaced. “It’s like being hit with a meteor.”
Mr. Trump frequently vents about how he is portrayed. He was enraged by an article this month in which his health secretary, Alex M. Azar II, was said to have warned Mr. Trump in January about the possibility of a pandemic. Mr. Trump was upset that he was being blamed while Mr. Azar was portrayed in a more favorable light, aides said. The president told friends that he assumed Mr. Azar was working the news media to try to save his own reputation at the expense of Mr. Trump’s.
Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, disputed that the president’s focus was on his news coverage, but said in a statement that “President Trump’s highest priority is the health and safety of the American people.”
Aides said the president’s low point was in mid-March, when Mr. Trump, who had dismissed the virus as “one person coming in from China” and no worse than the flu, saw deaths and infections from Covid-19 rising daily. Mike Lindell, a Trump donor campaign surrogate and the chief executive of MyPillow, visited the White House later that month and said the president seemed so glum that Mr. Lindell pulled out his phone to show him a text message from a Democratic-voting friend of his who thought Mr. Trump was doing a good job.
Mr. Lindell said Mr. Trump perked up after hearing the praise. “I just wanted to give him a little confidence,” Mr. Lindell said.
The Daily Briefings
The daily White House coronavirus task force briefing is the one portion of the day that Mr. Trump looks forward to, although even Republicans say that the two hours of political attacks, grievances and falsehoods by the president are hurting him politically.
Mr. Trump will hear none of it. Aides say he views them as prime-time shows that are the best substitute for the rallies he can no longer attend but craves.
Mr. Trump rarely attends the task force meetings that precede the briefings, and he typically does not prepare before he steps in front of the cameras. He is often seeing the final version of the day’s main talking points that aides have prepared for him for the first time although aides said he makes tweaks with a Sharpie just before he reads them live. He hastily plows through them, usually in a monotone, in order to get to the question-and-answer bullying session with reporters that he relishes.
The briefing’s critics, including Mr. Cuomo, have pointed out the obvious: With two hours of the president’s day dedicated to hosting what is still referred to as a prime-time news briefing, who is going to actually fix the pandemic?
Even Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the experts appointed to advise the president on the best way to handle the outbreak, has complained that the amount of time he must spend onstage in the briefings each day has a “draining” effect on him.
They have the opposite effect on the president. How he arrived at them was almost an accident.
Mr. Trump became enraged watching the coverage of his 10-minute Oval Office address in March that was rife with inaccuracies and had little in terms of action for him to announce. He complained to aides that there were few people on television willing to defend him.
The solution, aides said, came two days later, when Mr. Trump appeared in the Rose Garden to declare a national emergency and answer questions from reporters. As he admonished journalists for asking “nasty” questions, Mr. Trump found the back-and-forth he had been missing. The virus had not been a perfect enemy — it was impervious to his browbeating — but baiting and attacking reporters energized him.
“I don’t take responsibility at all,” Mr. Trump told White House correspondents in answer to one question.
His first news conference in the briefing room took place the next day, on a Saturday, after Mr. Trump arrived unannounced in the Situation Room, wearing a polo shirt and baseball cap, and told the group he planned to attend the briefing and watch from a chair on the side. When aides told him that reporters would simply yell questions at him, even if he was not on the small stage, he agreed to take the podium. He has not looked back since.
When Mr. Trump finishes up 90 or more minutes later, he heads back to the Oval Office to watch the end of the briefings on TV and compare notes with whoever is around from his inner circle.
The New Pecking Order
That circle has shrunk significantly as the president, who advisers say is more sensitive to criticism than at nearly any other point in his presidency, has come to rely on only a handful of longtime aides.
Hope Hicks, a former communications director who rejoined the White House this year as counselor to the president, maintains his daily schedule. His former personal assistant, Johnny McEntee, now runs presidential personnel.
Ms. Hicks and Mr. McEntee, along with Dan Scavino, the president’s social media guru who was promoted this week to deputy chief of staff for communications, provide Mr. Trump with a link to the better old days. The three are the ones outside advisers get in touch with to find out if it’s a good time to reach the president or pass on a message.
Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s new chief of staff, is still finding his footing and adjusting to the nocturnal habits of Mr. Trump, who recently placed a call to Mr. Meadows, a senior administration official said, at 3:19 a.m. Mr. Meadows works closely with another trusted insider: Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and de facto chief of staff.
“They have been really confined and figuratively imprisoned,” Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University, said about presidents who have kept close to the White House in times of crisis.
While many officials have been encouraged to work remotely and the Old Executive Office Building is empty, the West Wing’s tight quarters are still packed. Mr. Pence and his top aides, usually stationed across the street, are working exclusively from the White House, along with most of the senior aides, who dine from the takeout mess while the in-house dining room remains closed. Few aides wear masks except for Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser, and some of his staff.
The Day Ends as It Began
As soon as he gets to the Oval Office, the president often receives his daily intelligence briefing, and Mr. Pence sometimes joins him. Then there are meetings with his national security team or economic advisers.
Throughout the day, Mr. Trump calls governors, will have lunch with cabinet secretaries and pores over newspapers, which he treats like official briefing books and reads primarily in paper clippings that aides bring to him. He calls aides about stories he sees, either to order them to get a world leader on the phone or to ask questions about something he has read.
Many friends said they were less likely to call Mr. Trump’s cellphone, assuming he does not want to hear their advice. Those who do reach him said phone calls have grown more clipped: Conversations that used to last 20 minutes now wrap up in three.
Mr. Trump will still take calls from Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, on the latest on polling data. The president will in turn call Mr. Meadows and Kellyanne Conway about key congressional races.
The president’s aides have slowly lined up more opportunities to keep him engaged. Last week, a small group of coronavirus survivors were led into the White House, and Mr. Trump took one of them to see the White House physician. Then Mr. Trump hosted a celebration of America’s truckers on the South Lawn.
After he is done watching the end of the daily White House briefing — which is held seven days a week and sometimes goes as late as 8 p.m. — Mr. Trump watches television in his private dining room off the Oval Office. Assorted aides who are still around will join him to rehash the day and offer their assessments on the briefings. Comfort food — including French fries and Diet Coke — is readily available.
Lately, aides say, his mood has started to brighten as his administration moves to open the economy. His new line, both in public and in private, is that there is reason to be optimistic.
“And at the end of that tunnel, we see light,” Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden last week.
If he is not staying late in the West Wing, Mr. Trump occasionally has dinner with his wife, Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, who recently celebrated his 14th birthday at home.
By the end of the day, Mr. Trump turns back to his constant companion, television. Upstairs in the White House private quarters — often in his own bedroom or in a nearby den — he flicks from channel to channel, reviewing his performance.

Biden Will Fund-Raise With D.N.C. and His Appointee Will Lead the Committee,"Joe Biden’s presidential campaign is beginning to consolidate control over the Democratic National Committee and will have the ability to raise badly needed cash.
WASHINGTON — Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee have agreed to a joint fund-raising accord and installed the Biden campaign’s choice as the D.N.C.’s chief executive, the latest signs that the party’s presumptive presidential nominee has consolidated control over its broader functions.
The new agreement, which party officials said would be made formal on Friday, will allow the former vice president to raise $360,600 from individual donors, with $5,600 going to the Biden campaign and the rest earmarked for the party committee.
At the request of the Biden campaign, Mary Beth Cahill, a D.N.C. senior adviser who briefly served as its interim chief executive in 2018, will take over from Seema Nanda. Ms. Cahill, a longtime operative for the party, served as campaign manager for John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. Mr. Kerry is a longtime friend of and 2020 campaign surrogate for Mr. Biden. Ms. Nanda will leave the D.N.C.
The moves come as the Biden campaign exercises greater influence on the national committee, an effort that typically gets underway after a presidential nomination is assured. In the past, that has involved sending a team of aides to the party’s headquarters on South Capitol Street, but the coronavirus restrictions mean the Biden team will take over a party working from home.
“Our goal is to ensure that we put Joe Biden in the best position possible to beat Donald Trump,” Ms. Cahill said. “This joint fund-raising agreement allows us to do just that.”
Mr. Biden and the D.N.C. begin the general election period far behind President Trump and the Republican National Committee, which entered April with $244 million in the bank. Mr. Biden and the D.N.C. had a combined $57 million, after accounting for debts and the $18 million former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg transferred to the party following the failure of his $1 billion campaign.
The agreement to raise funds together should help Mr. Biden accelerate his efforts to close that substantial gap. Until this week, he had been legally limited to soliciting checks for only $5,600. Now he can directly ask for more than 60 times that amount with almost all of it going to the party committee.
Some donors had been confused in recent weeks at the delay for setting up such an accord. Ultimately, the initial agreement is exclusively between the D.N.C. and the Biden campaign; the maximum contribution is likely to increase in the future as Democratic state parties are included.
In 2016, an early joint agreement between Hillary Clinton and the D.N.C. was the subject of controversy as supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont complained that Mrs. Clinton was influencing the party through her financial support. Those residual feelings were one reason the D.N.C. and Mr. Biden avoided establishing such a pact until after Mr. Sanders had formally exited the race.
Ms. Cahill, an ally of the D.N.C. chairman, Tom Perez, since he worked with her in the office of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, ran the last Democratic presidential campaign against a Republican incumbent in the White House, when Mr. Kerry challenged President George W. Bush.
Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, praised Ms. Cahill’s appointment to lead the party.
“Mary Beth’s experience running presidential campaigns and managing the kind of complex operation it takes to win a general election will be invaluable, and I am thrilled to have her as a partner in this fight,” Ms. O’Malley Dillon said.
In addition, Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s former campaign manager, has been dispatched as a liaison between the campaign and the D.N.C. for the general election. He was replaced by Ms. O’Malley Dillon in March.
Another looming organizational choice for the Biden campaign is whether to contract with a digital services firm called Hawkfish that was created by Mr. Bloomberg ahead of his presidential run. The firm has pitched itself to run much of the Biden campaign’s digital operations, rather than the campaign building out its own internal operation, according to people familiar with the matter.
Hawkfish has quickly become a flash point in the party. Several Democratic digital operatives have warned the Biden campaign publicly and privately against contracting with Hawkfish, arguing that the firm has limited political experience and that its lone big race — for Mr. Bloomberg — did not include any fund-raising or efforts to spend money efficiently. Both are major imperatives for the Biden campaign.
On the other side, the firm is promising access to large amounts of data it has collected and fresh know-how from a Silicon Valley team imported from outside the usual circle of politics.
Whether or not to use Hawkfish is a hot-button decision thrust onto the desk of Ms. O’Malley Dillon, though conversations with the firm predate her taking over the campaign.

"Opposed to Bailouts, but in This Case Willing to Take One","Some conservative nonprofit groups are seeking financial help to weather the coronavirus crisis. Some liberal organizations are putting aside different qualms to make the same request.
WASHINGTON — Among the applicants for loans from the Small Business Administration’s stimulus package is the foundation arm of FreedomWorks, a conservative operation that advocates small government and made its name opposing bailouts.
“I would love someone to give us free cash,” said Adam Brandon, the president of FreedomWorks, which is working to build support for President Trump’s effort to reopen the economy.
At the other end of the ideological spectrum, liberal groups like the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center and Media Matters for America have also applied for some of the small-business loans, which can be fully forgiven if the recipients use them to keep workers on their payrolls.
The groups on the left may be more comfortable than those on the right with the idea of federal government assistance, but accepting help from an administration they regularly criticize has left them debating how to balance their independence with their ability to keep functioning during an economic crisis.
“It’s hard for me to imagine that any of these liberal groups are going to pull their punches on criticizing government because they got a loan,” said Gara LaMarche, the president of Democracy Alliance, a club of major liberal donors who support some of the top groups on the left, including Media Matters.
He said his staff was consulting with some of the groups to which the Democracy Alliance steered funds, and expected many would apply for S.B.A. loans “as a matter of sound management and stewardship.”
But Mr. LaMarche added, “It’s not hard to imagine Trump keeping track, and then not forgiving the loans of groups he deems critical!”
Many struggling mom-and-pop business have been unable to obtain S.B.A. loans from a program established as part of the $2.2 trillion bailout plan passed by Congress and signed into law by Mr. Trump, even as larger publicly traded businesses have obtained loans from the program.
A provision in the legislation, which socially conservative organizations recommended to Republican lawmakers, made clear that certain nonprofit groups could apply as well. The provision opened the door for taxpayer funding to subsidize well-connected organizations that are part of the political fray in an election year. And at least a few groups — on both sides of the political spectrum — decided to apply, so far with mixed results.
The Congressional Progressive Caucus Center’s application for a $160,000 loan is awaiting resolution, as is FreedomWorks Foundation’s request for $300,000, according to officials at the groups.
The American Civil Liberties Union’s national office has not applied but 14 of its state affiliates have, and at least one received a loan — of $154,000 — so far, said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the A.C.L.U.
A “small” loan request by Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group supporting Mr. Trump’s plan to reopen the country, is still pending, said the organization’s chairman. An application from Media Matters has been hampered by a technical problem, said a person familiar with the process, who was not aware if the group had reapplied.
The Small Business Administration has already spent the initial $349 billion allocated in the bailout bill for the loan program, known as the Paycheck Protection Program. But the program is set to get a $320 billion infusion from another bill that won final congressional approval on Thursday.
Various types of institutions and industries, including universities and news organizations, have been caught up in the debate over who should benefit from the $2.2 trillion bailout bill.
In the case of nonprofits, critics argue it is not a good use of government money to prop up groups trying to influence the political debate in the middle of a presidential campaign.
They point out that such groups do not pay taxes, and as such already receive a form of subsidy from the government. And they note that some taxpaying for-profit businesses that focus on politics are unable to avail themselves of the funding because Small Business Administration regulations prohibit loans to businesses that get more than half their revenue from political or lobbying work.
“There is a complete double standard,” said Eli B. Karabell, a political consultant in St. Louis who sought to apply for an $87,000 S.B.A. loan for his business, but was informed by his bank he was ineligible.
Mr. Karabell had to lay off three employees, according to a lawsuit the American Association of Political Consultants filed against the S.B.A. seeking to overturn the ban on loans to political businesses as an infringement on free speech.
“It is completely wrong and completely reprehensible for the government to be subsidizing these nonprofits, but our real Main Street, small-town businesses are not getting this money,” Mr. Karabell said.
Defenders note that the provision in the stimulus bill paving the way for S.B.A. loans to nonprofits applies to all groups registered under a section of the tax code — 501(c) (3) — that covers churches and other religious institutions, as well as charities and educational entities, most of which rely largely on donations. Some of those entities play important roles in communities across the country and employ significant numbers of people, some of whom might be out of a job if fund-raising declines as donors feel the pinch of the economic collapse.
While the tax code bans those groups from endorsing candidates or engaging in other partisan political activity, they are allowed to spend money advocating policy positions at the heart of political fights. And many of the most active political organizations maintain 501(c) (3) foundation arms, including FreedomWorks, which plans to use its FreedomWorks Foundation to publicize ideas on how to restart the economy. Its larger political arm is helping organize protests of state and local restrictions on business and travel intended to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
Liberty Counsel, which is leading a campaign to reopen churches next week, worked with allies on Capitol Hill to push for the inclusion of nonprofit groups in the S.B.A. section of the stimulus bill, according to Mat Staver, the group’s chairman.
“Obviously, with the stock market, people out of jobs, so many people unemployed, they’re not donating,” he said. “It still impacts any nonprofits whether you’re essential or not.”
The group submitted an application the morning the small-business process opened, but it has yet to receive a loan, which Mr. Staver attributed to larger corporations flooding the program.
Some conservative lawyers who represent such groups have encouraged them to apply partly as a matter of principle.
“Their financial situation is precarious, or will be, not because of anything they did or did not do — but because the governments at every level closed down the economy and cost them their donors’ ability to fund their programs,” said Cleta Mitchell, a conservative Washington lawyer who represents many nonprofit groups.
Not all conservative groups agree.
The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, decided not to apply for a loan, arguing in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that accepting the funds would be anathema to the group’s mission of promoting limited government.
In an interview, Cato’s president, Peter Goettler, called it “a moral issue of the state taking money from one group and giving it to another.”
For liberal groups like the A.C.LU.’s national office, the calculus is different but still complicated.
“The perception of independence is really important for an organization like ours that holds government’s feet to the fire,” Mr. Romero said.
Nonetheless, he said the organization did not prohibit its state affiliates from applying on their own, partly because they primarily serve as watchdogs against local and state governments.
Likewise, the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center, a nonprofit funded largely by donations from liberal foundations, said taking the assistance would not affect its work, which includes pushing for more assistance for workers in coronavirus relief legislation.
“We have not laid anyone off yet, and we’re hoping not to, but we’re facing significant financial uncertainty right now, as are a lot of other nonprofits,” said Liz Watson, the center’s executive director. “If we do get a loan, this will help us keep people in their jobs.”",politicsNews,4/24/2020,New York Times
Makers of Lysol Warn Against Ingesting Disinfectants,"Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Lysol and Dettol, and the authorities in Washington State said in separate remarks that people should not ingest or inject cleaning products. Industry officials echoed the warnings.
The makers of Lysol and state officials repeated warnings Thursday and Friday about the dangers of ingesting disinfectants or cleaning products as a way to treat or prevent illnesses caused by the coronavirus.
The remarks came after President Trump in a briefing on Thursday theorized about the possible medical benefits of sunlight, ultraviolet light and household disinfectants against the coronavirus.
Reckitt Benckiser, the British company that makes Lysol and Dettol, warned customers on Friday against using disinfectants as treatments, saying that “due to recent speculation and social media activity,” it had been asked about the “internal administration” of disinfectants.
“As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” it said in a statement, advising people to use the products in line with guidelines.
Accidents with household cleaning products appear to have sharply increased in recent weeks, according to doctors who monitor activity at poison call centers. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an alarming trend of growing calls to poison control centers, and a significant increase in accidental exposures to household cleaners and disinfectants.
Ingesting bleach and disinfectant chemicals is extremely dangerous, said Dr. Diane P. Calello, the medical director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System. “When people injected bleach or highly concentrated rubbing alcohol it causes massive organ damage and the blood cells in the body to basically burst,” she said. “It can definitely be a fatal event.”
On Friday, the American Cleaning Institute, which represents companies in the cleaning products industry in the United States, echoed the warnings against the improper use of disinfectants.
“Disinfectants are meant to kill germs or viruses on hard surfaces,” it said in a statement. “Under no circumstances should they ever be used on one’s skin, ingested or injected internally.”
Officials in Washington State, where researchers believe that hidden outbreaks of coronavirus were creeping through Seattle early this year, said Thursday night on Twitter that people should not consume laundry detergent capsules or “inject yourself with any kind of disinfectant.”
“Just don’t make a bad situation worse,” the state’s emergency management authorities said.
The message was an apparent reference to Mr. Trump’s remarks at the White House briefing on Thursday. William N. Bryan, the head of science at the Department of Homeland Security, told the briefing that the government had tested how sunlight and disinfectants — including bleach and alcohol — can kill the coronavirus on surfaces.
Mr. Trump then speculated about the possible medical application of disinfectants.
“And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute — one minute — and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning?” Mr. Trump asked. “Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”
On Friday morning, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said that Mr. Trump’s comments were taken out of context by the news media.
“President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing,” she said.
Doctors and manufacturers have warned for years about the risks associated with some household cleaners, and bottles of bleach and other disinfectants carry warnings saying that it is dangerous to ingest them, and potentially fatal.
In its report this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that calls to poison hotlines this year for cases involving cleaners and disinfectants rose significantly compared with the same period over the previous two years. The report charts a significant spike in March for both categories.
Dr. Calello, one of the authors of the report, said on Friday that there was no evidence to suggest that any of these disinfectant chemicals, tested on nonporous surfaces like countertops, can work inside the body to kill the coronavirus or any other virus.
The chemicals cause severe and potentially deadly damage inside a human body, she said.
“There are reports, tragically, of people who either in a misinformed attempt to clean their blood, or an attempt to harm themselves, inject themselves with chemicals,” said Dr. Calello, who works regular shifts at the New Jersey poison hotline.
There are no products, vaccines or drugs approved to treat or cure the coronavirus. Federal and local officials have previously spoken out against medical misinformation, particularly when it appears online or when untested products are advertised as cures for Covid-19 or other viruses and severe illnesses.
The Trump administration in March warned to stop selling products that claim to cure or prevent the coronavirus, including teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silvers.
But at White House briefings, Mr. Trump has issued medical advice for fighting the virus that goes well beyond scientific evidence, including about warmer temperatures and the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. Doctors have warned that misinformation around home remedies could prove disastrous, as when an Arizona man died and his wife was hospitalized after they ingested a chemical found in hydroxychloroquine.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump also asked officials about testing the effects of light on the virus. “Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light,” Mr. Trump said. “And I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but we’re going to test it?” he added, turning to Mr. Bryan, the Homeland Security official. “And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, either through the skin or some other way.”
Ultraviolet lamps can harm humans if used improperly, experts warn. When Mr. Trump asked Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, whether she had heard of the success of sunlight as an effective tool against viruses, and more specifically the coronavirus, she replied, “Not as a treatment.”",politicsNews,4/24/2020,New York Times
Did America Learn Anything From the Last Economic Crisis?,"Bailout fatigue is already starting to appear, particularly among Republicans.
Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Even when that history is only a decade old, evidently.
The global financial crisis, the deep recession it caused, and the weak recovery that followed have produced plenty of lessons about helping the economy escape from a period of trauma. The United States seems to be ignoring some of them in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Several prominent Republicans in recent days have raised alarm bells about rising public debt. They’ve also indicated their opposition to further financial help for state and local governments. Leaders of both parties in Congress have structured business bailouts as loans from the Federal Reserve rather than as direct assistance to struggling companies.
And signs of bailout fatigue are already starting to appear, particularly among Republicans — raising the risk that government help for the economy will dry up before a potential coronavirus depression is contained — which was a key reason the last economic recovery was so slow for so long.
“The pandemic response got off to a really promising start, with everyone coming together with a whatever-it-takes attitude,” said Jason Furman, who shaped economic policy in response to the global financial crisis as a staffer in the Obama White House. “But we’re slipping back into the types of gridlock, over-optimism about the economy and over-pessimism on the deficit that followed the financial crisis and unnecessarily prolonged the economic pain.”
Consider a few of the experiences from that earlier episode that might inform the pandemic response.
In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, there were heated bipartisan warnings about excessive public debt — warnings that the United States risked hitting a tipping point of spiking interest rates and fiscal crisis if it did not curtail borrowing.
A high-profile bipartisan commission was formed to plan ways to reduce the trajectory of deficits. The Obama White House and congressional Republicans in 2011 embarked on lengthy negotiations over a “grand bargain” to reduce future entitlement spending.
Those efforts came to naught. But not only did no debt crisis occur — the opposite happened. Interest rates and inflation have stayed persistently low for the last decade, and demand for Treasury bonds has remained very high.
With the economy now in free fall, even many fiscal hawks are embracing large-scale deficit spending to help the economy emerge from the pandemic in better shape. Interest rates have fallen to record lows — 10-year Treasury bonds yielded only 0.6 percent Thursday — indicating investors are willing to lend to the U.S. government on generous terms. Economists see the last crisis as a reminder that deficit spending during a recession is desirable if it can prevent long-term economic damage.
“A key lesson from the 2008 period is that crises can have long shadows if there is damage to the economic structure,” said Karen Dynan, a Harvard economist and a former Treasury Department official. “The economic scarring if lots of businesses go bankrupt and households are wiped out financially in this episode would be a failure of policy. Based on the 2008 experience, a real concern is that we will tire of fiscal stimulus before the need for that money runs out.”
Already, there is uncertainty about the federal government’s willingness to support states financially — which has a particular parallel with the not-too-distant past.
In early 2010, the private sector in the United States turned a corner and began consistently creating jobs. But around the same time, state and local governments were facing the delayed effects of plunging tax revenue. Unlike the federal government, states generally must balance their budgets, and do not have a central bank to ensure their access to funds.
As a result, their only option was to enact huge spending cuts just as the rest of the economy was starting to turn around. State and local governments shed 570,000 jobs from 2010 to 2012, contributing to a perennially weak economic recovery. If an extra 570,000 people had been working at the end of 2012, the jobless rate would have been 7.5 percent instead of 7.9 percent. Some funds had been allocated to states in the 2009 fiscal stimulus bill, but Congress was unwilling to seriously consider the possibility of allocating more.
Republicans were dead set against the idea of bailing out states’ finances, and even many Democrats in Congress were wary, disinclined to help political rivals in state houses and governors’ mansions.
Now, states face plummeting tax revenue and new costs tied to treatment of the virus. Republicans blocked Democratic requests to add more money for states in the latest rescue legislation, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday that “there’s not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations” and that states should consider filing for bankruptcy if necessary.
The ground may also be shifting on programs to encourage businesses to keep making payroll.
Controversies that have emerged around programs to support small businesses suggest that the politics of industry bailouts are becoming more toxic. Outcry over some midsize companies that obtained forgivable loans through the Paycheck Protection Program suggests that public stigma and political blowback could be attached to taking advantage of the federal rescue — which could undermine the ability of the program to fulfill its goal of preventing layoffs even as Congress scales up its size.
“Identifying individual companies and trying to paint a picture of a program that’s not doing well does suggest that the kind of bailout fatigue that existed 12 years ago is lurking very close to the surface and may even be popping up above the surface,” said Michael Strain, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
Finally, Congress has repeated another behavior from the global financial crisis: relying to an extraordinary degree on the Federal Reserve to carry out steps aimed at fixing the economy, rather than taking direct action itself.
In 2008, that meant the Bush administration relied on the Fed to rescue Bear Stearns and AIG; in 2009, it meant the Obama administration used a Fed program to support lending as a key part of its crisis response. For years thereafter, as Congress refrained from new fiscal action, the Fed enacted quantitative easing to try to keep the economy on track.
The Fed has a lot of strengths. It is run by capable technocrats, can act quickly, and has the unique capacity to create dollars out of thin air. But it also has limitations. Its tools generally work through financial markets, which means it is better at improving financial conditions generally than at helping individual industries that are experiencing problems.
And though it has wide authority to lend money to solvent borrowers, it is not legally allowed to spend money — for example, to directly pay businesses to keep their payrolls high, or to send money to individuals.
Now, the core of the Trump administration’s strategy — with bipartisan support in Congress — has been to authorize Treasury funds to be used by the Fed for new programs to lend to businesses.
“The Fed is great at stabilizing the financial system, but it’s not well designed to target specific segments of the economy,” said David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “Giving grants is a much more effective and efficient manner of helping businesses out than the Fed giving loans.”
In that sense, Congress’s desire to avoid the sticker shock of spending huge sums directly could make its rescue efforts less effective than they otherwise might have been.
In all these areas, the great test for the government is whether it can engineer a response enabling the economy to come out of the pandemic without being much smaller — without the years of inadequate growth that followed the 2008 crisis, which kept millions of people from fulfilling their productive potential for years.
If the recent trends hold up, the post-pandemic years could be another way in which history repeats itself.",politicsNews,4/24/2020,New York Times
Trump Is Harsh on Immigration. That Doesn’t Mean Biden Has the Latino Vote.,"Some Democrats worry that their party is taking a crucial bloc for granted in 2020.
LOS ANGELES — There’s talk of protecting the country from the “Invisible Enemy” by temporarily blocking people from receiving green cards. New footage of the construction of the southern border wall is available to stream online from a government website. If there was any doubt, this week made it clear: President Trump is making his anti-immigration message a cornerstone of his re-election campaign.
And yet Latino voters are not, so far, indicating they will turn out in decisive numbers for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is counting on their support to win key swing states including Arizona, Florida and Pennsylvania. New polling indicates that 45 percent of Latinos approve of the president’s handling of the coronavirus.
While Mr. Biden remains the choice of the majority of registered Hispanic voters, at 59 percent, Mr. Trump is the choice of 22 percent, according to a poll released Friday by Latino Decisions, a Los Angeles-based Democratic polling firm. Though the polling was conducted before his most recent statements and actions on immigration and the coronavirus, it is the latest evidence that Mr. Trump maintains steady support from a significant slice of Latino voters. Several polls of Latinos in battleground states have consistently shown Mr. Trump receiving slightly more than 20 percent of the votes.
The poll also shows that enthusiasm for Mr. Biden seems to be slipping — he was favored by 67 percent of registered Latino voters in February.
“Even as Trump is continuing this immigrant bashing, these voters are not blaming him for what is going on in the country right now — they are giving him the benefit of the doubt,” said Matt Barreto, who runs the polling firm. “There is an enthusiasm deficit — people are losing their jobs, losing their health care, losing their house, and they are not hearing how the Democratic Party is trying to solve that.”
Latinos are expected to be the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc this fall, and Democrats have made it clear that they believe record turnout from the group will lead to significant victories in states that are crucial to recapturing the White House. Before the pandemic, many political operatives said they were seeing unprecedented levels of engagement and excitement from Latinos, in part driven by anger over what they view as the Trump administration’s damaging messages and policy on immigration.
But many Latino operatives have repeatedly warned Democrats not to take these voters for granted. Presuming that anger with the Trump administration will easily translate into a victory for Mr. Biden is a mistake, they say. The concern, they argue, is an enthusiasm gap — less that Latinos will turn to Mr. Trump, but that they won’t vote at all. In a poll conducted in late February, 73 percent of Latino voters said they were “almost certain” to vote in November. Two months later, that number has dropped to 60 percent.
“I don’t want anybody to take the Latino community of this country for granted, and we tend to do that,” said Henry Muñoz, a former Democratic Party official who helped start Somos, a network of health professionals in New York City, and who paid for the poll. “Latinos don’t vote because they don’t believe that anyone in office has their back. They don’t think that if they vote or if they organize, that anything that happens will impact their family.”
Many Latino leaders have urged Mr. Biden’s campaign to learn from Senator Bernie Sanders. His primary campaign attracted widespread enthusiasm from Latino voters, particularly among young voters and in the West, where he won the California and Nevada nominating contests. The Sanders campaign invested early and heavily in attracting Latino voters, drawing on activists with longstanding ties to their local communities.
“Sanders is the only presidential campaign that ever put their money where their mouth is and cleaned everybody else’s clock — that’s a lesson for everyone,” said Tony Cárdenas, a Democratic congressman from Los Angeles who has backed Mr. Biden and serves as the chairman of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “No campaign should ever think that just because somebody else has scapegoated the Latino community, that’s it — that in and of itself is not going to get it done.”
Biden campaign officials have assured Mr. Cárdenas and others that they will aggressively expand Latino outreach.
Despite Mr. Trump’s relentless focus on immigration, the issue was never seen as a top priority for Democrats during the primary. Though the candidates roundly criticized the administration’s policies on family separations, few clearly articulated how they would handle vexing immigration policy questions as president. Immigration activists complained and interrupted several debates to draw more attention to the issue, and criticized Mr. Biden for his role in the Obama administration, which deported more than 2.5 million immigrants.
Latino political leaders have long urged candidates to think beyond immigration when trying to appeal to Latino voters. And the pandemic has brought to the forefront many issues that have long been a focus for Latinos — inequality, access to health care, jobs and education.
Marisa Franco, the executive director of Mijente, a Latino activist group that endorsed Mr. Sanders in the primary and has yet to officially back Mr. Biden, said she wanted to see the campaign do more to attract grass-roots support.
“What the Sanders campaign really did was bring people in, who then went back into the neighborhoods where they are from, where they are trusted, and made a pitch that is much more compelling,” Ms. Franco said. “I think that’s what the Biden campaign hasn’t done and that’s something they will have to really grapple with.”
The Trump campaign has frequently said that it plans to reach out to Latino voters, particularly in more conservative parts of the country. Even small inroads among those voters could help the campaign win states like Texas and Florida.
“Many Latinos support President Trump because they understand that his policies actually help families like theirs,” said Ali Pardo, a spokeswoman for the campaign. “The president doesn’t make empty promises — he supercharged America’s economy once, and he will do it again.”
Of course, no campaign in modern history has taken place amid a pandemic. Political organizers are trying to figure out how to adapt as people struggle with their own basic needs. And at a time when Mr. Trump is holding daily televised briefings, Mr. Biden is still figuring out how to break through to voters broadly.
“Right now, President Trump is failing to give Americans the leadership they demand to solve the dual public health and economic crises that we are facing — which are hitting communities of color especially hard — and this poll shows that Latinos are paying attention,” said Cristóbal Alex, a senior adviser on the Biden campaign.  “As we approach November, we will continue, and expand, our aggressive outreach in the Latino community to turn that vision into votes.”
Mr. Barreto said of the president, “Latino communities are being devastated right now, and Democrats have the chance to annihilate him on this.”
He added, “I think the worry for the Democrats is the perception that he appears to be managing is going unchallenged, and the longer that happens, the more damaging it is.”",politicsNews,4/24/2020,New York Times
House to Examine Ouster of Health Official Who Doubted Drugs Trump Pushed,"The chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce health subcommittee said she planned to hold hearings on Rick Bright’s dismissal as the head of an agency helping to develop a coronavirus vaccine.
WASHINGTON — A key House subcommittee chairwoman said on Thursday that she planned to hold hearings into the departure of Rick Bright, who said he was removed as the head of an agency involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine after he pressed for rigorous vetting of unproven drugs embraced by President Trump to combat the virus.
“I know that life is difficult for members to travel, but we can’t let that get in the way and I’m sure that other members would want to be a part of a hearing as well,” said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, the chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee. Ms. Eshoo, a California Democrat, helped create the agency that Dr. Bright oversaw, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
The congresswoman spoke as Dr. Bright’s lawyers, in a statement, said that officials at the Health and Human Services Department, which BARDA is a part of, had made “demonstrably false” statements about Dr. Bright’s tenure, and that they planned to file whistle-blower complaints against the agency.
Dr. Bright was abruptly dismissed this week from his BARDA post and as the department’s deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response, and was given a narrower job at the National Institutes of Health. In response, he issued a remarkable public statement accusing the Trump administration of putting cronyism over science, especially with two malaria drugs that the president has promoted as game changers in the treatment of the virus.
Ms. Eshoo said that among the witnesses she would like to hear from are the secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, and an assistant secretary, Dr. Robert P. Kadlec, who supervised Dr. Bright.
“I think the American people deserve to know what happened here, because all of our collective fate rested on” the development of a vaccine, she said.
The Democratic chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, formally requested that the Health and Human Services Department’s inspector general also look into Dr. Bright’s removal and transfer.
“Removing Dr. Bright in the midst of a pandemic would raise serious concerns under any circumstances, but his allegations that political considerations influenced this decision heighten those concerns and demand full accountability,” Mr. Pallone wrote.
In his statement, Dr. Bright said: “Contrary to misguided directives, I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit. While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.”
Officials at the department have disputed Dr. Bright’s account and insisted there were problems with his management style. But they have so far refused to say so on the record.
A performance review from September signed by Dr. Kadlec concluded, “Dr. Bright continues to lead change in BARDA with deftness and enthusiasm.”
And in an internal email sent on Tuesday evening, Dr. Kadlec again offered praise as he described Dr. Bright’s new role in a “Shark Tank”-style effort to develop diagnostics related to the coronavirus, a collaboration between his former agency and the National Institutes of Health.
“Rick brings extensive experience and expertise in facilitating powerful public-private partnerships that advance the health and well-being of the American people,” Dr. Kadlec wrote in the email. “Under Rick’s leadership, BARDA has made tremendous progress and with the skills and knowledge he has amassed across a long career in virology and, in particular, over the past four years as our BARDA director, I know he will drive and enable” the new effort.
Ms. Eshoo said that she had worked with Dr. Bright and that he was “a thoroughbred professional.”
“This is a terrible, swift sword that has come at science, and Dr. Bright,” she said.
BARDA is a technical agency, established after the Sept. 11 attacks, that works to counter chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, as well as threats from pandemic influenza. It has flexibility to fund promising research and to team up with pharmaceutical companies to advance the development of countermeasures necessary to protect the health of the American public, with the aim of having the Food and Drug Administration approve them for inclusion in the national stockpile.
Dr. Bright, a virologist, arrived at the agency when Barack Obama was president. He ran its anti-viral program, and was then promoted to other jobs, including heading the influenza and emerging infectious disease branch and working on the response to the Zika virus, before becoming its director in 2016.
“This is the removal of somebody with a very clear scientific mind and good judgment,” said Marie-Paule Kieny, a French scientist and former official at the World Health Organization, who worked with Dr. Bright on developing vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza. “Rick is very reflective. He is not somebody who gets excited or screams. He looks at the evidence, he looks at the science and then he confers.”
Like many career officials who worked under Mr. Obama, he was not greeted warmly by the Trump team. Officials at the Health and Human Services Department described Dr. Bright as difficult and high maintenance, despite the favorable review he had been given by Dr. Kadlec. And people familiar with the discussions said department officials had been talking about moving him out of his role for several months.
In a statement on Wednesday night aimed at disputing Dr. Bright’s claim that he objected to the way the administration wanted to distribute chloroquines, a department spokeswoman said Dr. Bright had been the person who had put in for an emergency-use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration. A person familiar with Dr. Bright’s account said that was his compromise to get some regulations in place for how the drugs were used.",politicsNews,4/23/2020,New York Times
Treasury Clarifies Small-Business Loans as Fed Vows Transparency,"The two institutions, actively deploying hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer funding, moved to assuage concerns about where the money is going.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Thursday to ensure that large corporations with access to capital are not improperly taking emergency small-business loans and the Federal Reserve committed to greater immediate transparency about how its bailout funds are deployed, amid growing concerns about how hundreds of billions of dollars of economic relief money are being allocated.
The actions came as Congress passed a $484 billion supplemental relief package to replenish an initial $349 billion program for small businesses, as well as providing more support for hospitals and expanding coronavirus testing capacity.
The Paycheck Protection Program, which gives forgivable loans for small companies that keep workers on the payroll, has stirred controversy as big, well-connected companies received money before many smaller ones. With the government required to provide few details about those recipients, concern has increased that the Treasury Department is shrouding its programs in secrecy — and that the Fed, once its own trillion-dollar efforts are up and running, will do the same.
On Thursday, the Treasury Department warned big publicly traded companies that they must prove they are in need of emergency small-business loans to keep their operations going and have no other option to receive financing or repay the funds.
The department updated its “Frequently Asked Questions” page about the Paycheck Protection Program to urge “large companies with adequate sources of liquidity” to think twice before applying for small-business loans that are backed by the Small Business Administration.
The Small Business Administration’s $349 billion fund to support these loans ran out last week and is expected to be replenished this week with another $310 billion. Anger over the program’s fairness has escalated as some big restaurant chains, including Shake Shack, received $10 million loans for their subsidiaries.
The Treasury Department notes that by law, small-business loans are intended to be taken in cases when the money is “necessary to support the ongoing operations.” It said that borrowers needed to certify that requirement in “good faith” and take into account their ability to gain access to other sources of money, such as issuing stock or selling bonds.
“For example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith,” the department said.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned businesses that they will be investigated and could face penalties if they improperly accept small-business money. He has urged businesses to return those funds. The guidance does not, however, force companies to return the money or accelerate repayments.
It remains unclear how the Treasury Department or the Small Business Administration will pursue investigations of loans that were given to borrowers that should not have been eligible. For the loans to be fully forgiven, businesses are required to demonstrate to banks that they met requirements to maintain staffing levels for eight weeks. The documentation that they provide could be subject to audits by the Internal Revenue Service.
The guidance released on Thursday said borrowers that repay loans in full by May 7 will be deemed by the Small Business Administration to have made their certifications in good faith, leaving them in good standing with the government.
At least four public companies, Shake Shack, Kura Sushi USA, Ruth’s Hospitality Group and ItWorks, have said that they have already given back the funds from the Paycheck Protection Program. Sweetgreen, which is privately held, also said it had returned its $10 million loan.
The Fed, which is infusing even more money into the financial system through its various facilities, said on Thursday that it would publicly disclose the names of companies that benefited from several of its lending programs.
The Fed said it would also release the amount borrowed and interest rate charged as well as overall costs, revenues and fees on programs backed by Congress’s recent appropriations. The Fed Board will publish program reports on its website at least every 30 days, without blacking out the information.
Congress has handed the Treasury Department $454 billion to support Fed lending facilities, which are meant to keep credit flowing through the financial system. Using that layer of taxpayer insurance, the Fed has announced programs that are meant to help midsize businesses, state governments, and large corporations.
The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Mr. Mnuchin are required to regularly report to Congress on the programs, but it was unclear how much detail they would disclose publicly and in real time.
“This is a significant victory for the public,” Bharat Ramamurti, the first member of the Congressional Oversight Commission responsible for overseeing the Fed programs, posted on Twitter after the release. “You will now know on a monthly basis which companies are getting support and how much support they’re getting.”
The policy outlined on Thursday will apply to initiatives backed by new funding, according to the Fed. Those include two corporate bond-buying programs, a municipal bond-buying program and an effort to help midsize business. Those efforts are not underway.
Programs meant to keep short-term markets functioning, which were announced and in some cases activated before the money was appropriated, will continue to report detailed information about participants on a delay.
While the Fed must provide participant information to Congress while the programs are operating, the Dodd-Frank law only requires officials to make detailed disclosures public a year after the programs end.
Fed officials have yet to decide which set of rules will apply to two of their programs — one that effectively buys bundles of consumer and business debt, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, and another that moves small business loans off bank balance sheets. Neither uses funding from the coronavirus relief bill, known as the CARES Act.
“This seems to me like the Fed trying to pre-empt some of the issues that really plagued them in and around the financial crisis,” said Mark Spindel, who wrote a book about the Fed as a creature of Congress. “There’s no better way to be sensitive to the politics than to be open about who’s getting” the money.",politicsNews,4/23/2020,New York Times
"As Coronavirus Threatens, Teenage Migrants ‘Age Out’ Into ICE Jails","Those initially detained by the government’s Office of Refugee Resettlement are being held until their 18th birthday, then transferred to ICE custody.
WASHINGTON — Isaac, a 17-year-old Guatemalan, crossed the U.S. border nearly eight months ago and was detained as a minor by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement, long before the novel coronavirus existed.
As his 18th birthday approached last month, it appeared he would be released to a Texas shelter where the director promised that the teenager would be “provided counseling and referred for any medical assistance he may require” for high blood pressure, severe anxiety and, if necessary, Covid-19, should the virus reach the shelter.
Instead, on the day he became an adult in the eyes of the U.S. government, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement swooped in and shipped him to the Otero County Processing Center in El Paso, where he says he sleeps arm’s distance away from dozens of other immigrants.
“I have no doctor. I have medication but it is one given to me in the previous shelter, when I was a minor,” said Isaac, who asked to be identified only by his middle name for fear of retaliation.
Around 32,000 migrants remain in custody on civil charges as ICE faces growing pressure to address the health concerns posed by the spreading coronavirus, including scores like Isaac who were initially taken into custody as minors, then held long enough to age into the adult detention center. As of Wednesday night, ICE had confirmed 287 cases of the virus among detainees and 35 cases among staff members.
Earlier this year, lawyers representing two migrants argued in a class-action suit that the Department of Homeland Security and ICE had violated a statute that mandates how migrant children should be protected by relying on dubious technology and the discretion of individual local field offices. As a result, instead of minors going to a group home, they are ending up in ICE jails.
The administration’s system of deciding where to place such “age outs” exemplifies the extent of President Trump’s hard-line immigration policies. Those moves include an executive order signed on Wednesday that restricts legal immigration into the United States and obscure procedural maneuvers like age-out detentions that not only limit opportunities to claim refuge in the country but also could expose a vulnerable population to the pandemic. The Education Department this week even prohibited higher education institutions from offering emergency assistance to undocumented students who were brought to the United States as children and are currently protected from deportation.
The coronavirus has re-energized the president’s immigration efforts, even as it brings new scrutiny. A federal judge in California this week ordered ICE to review the cases of detainees at high risk of catching the virus, including those over the age of 55.
But the coronavirus has also amplified concerns over the already contentious — and possibly illegal — practice of moving young migrants like Isaac on their 18th birthday from relatively benign shelters managed by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement into the Department of Homeland Security’s ICE detention centers.
While the safest option for the teenagers would be to be released to a sponsor, immigration lawyers say the shelters and group homes would provide more space and care than the detention facilities, where they say the young migrants would be mixed with another contingent population and be exposed to the virus, as well as psychological harm.
“Our clients are terrified of the prospect of being transferred to a secured detention facility with large numbers of people in close, confined settings, which is in direct contravention with C.D.C.’s advice on how to save oneself from this pandemic,” said Anthony Enriquez, the director of the unaccompanied minors program at Catholic Charities, who is representing another teenager in New York who in recent weeks was handcuffed by ICE agents on his 18th birthday and moved to a detention center.
“This is a real recipe for a humanitarian disaster,” Mr. Enriquez said.
Beyond the health risks are legal questions: A federal judge in the District of Columbia will soon rule on whether the Trump administration’s age-out effort violates the law.
By choosing to detain teenagers instead of releasing them to group homes or sponsors, lawyers argue, the administration has violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which requires the government to consider “the least restrictive setting available” to the migrants.
In Houston, ICE agents placed 97 percent of teenagers transferred from the resettlement office’s custody into detention centers as opposed to group homes, according to an analysis of government data from October 2018 to May 2019 submitted during trial. In Miami it was 96 percent and in El Paso 80 percent.
Lawyers for young detainees said the government had proved it did not have to happen that way. An ICE agent from the San Antonio field office, where placement statistics are considerably better, testified during the trial that if the resettlement office had not matched a teenager with a sponsor, he would find a group home that would take the migrant in. ICE agents in San Antonio placed just 2.6 percent of young migrants into detention facilities as opposed to releasing them to group homes or sponsors between October 2018 and May 2019.
“We don’t detain our age-outs,” the ICE officer, Jose Munguia, testified.
April Grant, a spokeswoman for ICE, declined to comment on the details of the continuing litigation. Ms. Grant said that when deciding whether to detain migrants who were aging out, the agency considered whether they were flight risks or dangers to themselves or the community, as well as whether an alternative space was available.
While such transfers occurred in previous administrations, the Trump administration is using a rigged system that ensures immigrants in certain parts of the country will be detained when they turn 18, according to Stephen Patton, one of the lead lawyers in the trial litigated by the National Immigrant Justice Center and Kirkland & Ellis in the District of Columbia. ICE’s computerized “risk classification assessment” system allows agents to enter a migrant’s information, then recommends detention or release.
But according to court documents, the agency tweaked the tool in August 2017 to eliminate the option of release, leaving only the recommendations of “detain” or “supervisor to determine.”
A worksheet requiring ICE agents to document their considerations for alternatives to detention did not include a space to detail the potential shelters available. Agents are left with two options: “detain” or “not detain.”
“There was not a shred of evidence that releasing these kids caused any problems or finding sponsors for them was an undue burden,” Mr. Patton said. “They could comply if they wanted to, and if they do comply almost everyone gets released.”
Another issue with resettling minors has been the Trump administration’s efforts to require sponsors to provide fingerprints to the government. That has discouraged immigrant relatives from coming forward to claim minors in custody, immigration advocates say.
In the 2019 fiscal year, 2,055 migrants were transferred to ICE custody, nearly double the 1,091 in the 2017 fiscal year, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Mark Weber, a department spokesman, said more than 140 young migrants had been handed over to ICE in 2020, but that is a small percentage of the children who cross the border each year and most are eventually matched with sponsors.
Mr. Weber said the department grappled with the most border crossings in more than a decade last year and was still able to place 72,593 children with sponsors. He said “a special effort” was made to release the children before they turn 18.
Ms. Grant, the ICE spokeswoman, declined to say how many of the migrants who turned 18 and were transferred to ICE custody were placed into a group home by the deportation agency.
The agency has also resisted calls for the widespread releases of migrants as the coronavirus approached, though nearly 700 have been released during the pandemic. Matthew T. Albence, the acting director of ICE, told the House Oversight Committee last week that such a move would be a “huge pull factor” and create a “rush at the borders,” according to a statement from the committee. The agency said in a statement that it was continuing to consider releasing immigrants to “alternatives to detention options.”
Those who have aged into the ICE detention centers say the virus has only added to concerns that include threats from fellow detainees, poor treatment by the staff and a lack of medical resources.
Sulma Hernandez Alfaro, who fled to the border to escape abusive relatives in Honduras, said she was confused when ICE agents showed up at the government shelter where she was staying in San Benito, Texas, in 2017. She had already been told by the staff that she would be released to a nearby group home, La Posada Providencia, when she turned 18.
Her lawyers’ pleas to ICE to release her to the group home went unanswered, according to court filings.
She said she was threatened by other detainees and treated poorly by the detention center’s staff. On one occasion, a guard yelled at her when she asked for a tampon. When she asked for a spare change of clothes, she was scolded.
“She just yelled at me and said I should just wash it in the sink because that’s why I have hands,” Ms. Alfaro said.
A court ordered Ms. Alfaro’s release in May 2018, six days before she was granted asylum.
Those are the same protections Jose Hernandez Velasquez hoped to obtain when he crossed the border in 2017.
Mr. Velasquez was erroneously moved from the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement as a 17-year-old after he was given a dental exam that mistakenly determined he was an adult, according to his lawyers, who later obtained a birth certificate proving he was a minor. By then he had already spent 10 months in a maximum-security detention center. Such dental assessments are supposed to be used to determine ages only in conjunction with other evidence.
“They told me that I was over the age and I wasn’t a minor even though I pleaded with them that I was. They just took me away,” Mr. Velasquez said in a February telephone interview from the Adelanto detention center in California.
He was placed back into a detention facility when he turned 18. In addition to facing threats from other detainees, he said he developed depression and hypertension while detained.
A federal judge this month ordered Mr. Velasquez to be released after his lawyers said in court filings that he was “vulnerable to serious disease” and that there was danger of the coronavirus spreading “uncontrollably with devastating results” in the detention center.
Mr. Velasquez is now quarantining himself as a precaution. But before he went to self-isolate in Los Angeles, he asked his lawyer to stop by the beach. He had not seen the ocean in nearly three years.",politicsNews,4/23/2020,New York Times
Executive Order Halting New Green Cards Includes Exceptions,"The order will affect thousands of people seeking to immigrate to the United States, but it does not apply to immigrants already in the country, nor to those seeking temporary visas.
WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday temporarily blocking the issuance of green cards to those outside the United States, but the measure includes numerous exemptions, like those for overseas spouses and young children of American citizens.
The order, which will be in place for at least 60 days, will affect thousands of parents, adult children and siblings of citizens seeking to immigrate to the United States. Under the measure, a diversity visa lottery that issues about 50,000 visas each year will be suspended, and green card holders in the United States will be prevented from reuniting with their spouses abroad.
But it does not apply to immigrants already in the United States, nor to those seeking temporary visas, including students or guest workers like farmers.
Other exceptions include health care professionals and their families as well as people in the EB-5 program, who invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs that create jobs.
Also exempt from the order are members of the military and their children, as well as Iraqis and those from Afghanistan who obtain a visa by assisting military operations. The policy could, however, be expanded; Mr. Trump’s top cabinet officials will convene in at least 30 days to review any restrictions on “nonimmigrant visas,” including visas for seasonal workers.
While the president often rails against illegal immigration and promotes the construction of a wall along the southwestern border, the order is focused on the family-based immigration he and his allies have frequently assailed as “chain-based migration.”
“It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. “We must first take care of the American worker.”
But as the pandemic touches every corner of daily life, including the economy, few employers are reaching out for workers at home or abroad. And critics have emphasized research that shows immigrants have a positive effect on the economy. Immigrants and their potential employers are also already subject to a certification process to ensure that there are an insufficient number of American workers to fill any potential job.
“He’s saying the system, the labor protections existing in the statute right now, are not good enough,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration and cross border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The executive order “means families will be separated, employers who have spent a lot of money and a lot of time to say, ‘This is the person I need for my company,’ will not have that person, and I can imagine they will not take kindly to this,” Ms. Brown said.
Mr. Trump said this week he would impose a more sweeping order, saying he intended to close the United States to people trying to immigrate to the country to live and work. But under intense pressure from business groups, he backed off barring guest workers for technology companies, farms as well as other employers. Still, some business groups said they were frustrated by the move.
“Given the unprecedented economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, it is especially important now to welcome the world’s top innovators and job creators, not send them home,” said John Neuffer, the chief of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group.
More than one million immigrants were granted green cards in the 2019 fiscal year, and about half of them — 458,556 — were overseas. Many of those visas went to the spouses and children of citizens.
Mr. Trump’s initial announcement, issued on Twitter late Monday night, that he intended to “suspend immigration” surprised many of his top officials in the Homeland Security and Defense Departments. The administration had already used authorities granted to Mr. Trump’s top health officials to effectively seal the southern border, and halt refugee flights and naturalization ceremonies. The State Department had suspended visa services last month at U.S. embassies and consulates, but immigrants were still able to take procedural steps to come to the United States.
Hours before Mr. Trump signed the order, Kellyanne Conway, his top adviser, said lawyers were still completing the policy. The executive order seemed to acknowledge there might be issues with the ban’s enactment, noting that if any provisions were “held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements,” the relevant agency should subsequently fulfill those requirements.
Mr. Trump has said that he may extend the policy after 60 days “based on economic conditions at the time.”
Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president and chief of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said that “economically speaking, the thinking behind this order plays into the patently flawed idea that American prosperity is a zero-sum game.”
“To the contrary, we see consistently that immigrants are essential, entrepreneurial, taxpaying, and job-creating members of society,” she said.",politicsNews,4/22/2020,New York Times
Trump’s Scientists Push Back on His Claim That Virus May Not Return This Fall,"The president has continued to broadcast his personal hopes for the coronavirus, questioning its ability to last into the fall and winter.
WASHINGTON — In February, President Trump told the public that the coronavirus should “go away” by April. In March, he said that the virus may “wash” away by summer. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the American public that the virus “won’t be coming back in the form that it was” this fall or winter. He then mused that it might not come back at all.
The scientists flanking him at a White House briefing explicitly said otherwise.
“There will be coronavirus in the fall,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, said as Mr. Trump looked on.
More than 40,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the outbreak is still well underway. But in his public remarks, Mr. Trump has continued to broadcast his personal hopes for the virus, questioning its ability to last into the fall and winter.
“If we have embers of corona coupled with the flu,” Mr. Trump said, “it’s not going to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape or form,” after saying, “It’s also possible it doesn’t come back at all.”
The president’s latest assertion seemed prompted by his anger with The Washington Post over an interview with Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published a day earlier. In that interview, Dr. Redfield warned that fall and winter would be taxing on Americans because influenza and the coronavirus would be circulating at the same time.
“He was misquoted,” Mr. Trump said.
“His whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot so that next fall we don’t have such a big season of flu,” the president continued.
But when pressed by reporters, Dr. Redfield said he had been accurately quoted. “There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” he said in that interview.
On Wednesday, directed by the president to take the stage, Dr. Redfield said, “When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time.”
He added: “I didn’t say that this was going to be worse. I said that this was going to be more difficult.” Taking the lectern to quibble with reporters over the article — which had the headline “C.D.C. Director Warns Second Wave of Coronavirus Is Likely to Be Even More Devastating” — Mr. Trump said that Dr. Redfield did not actually know if “the corona” would come back, and that he had spoken to the doctor at “great length” about his comments.
Asked how he could repeatedly assert that the coronavirus would come back in pockets or not at all by the winter, Mr. Trump said multiple times that there was reason to believe it might not. Health experts — including Dr. Redfield — have stressed that Americans need to be prepared either way.
“If it does come back, it’s not going to come back, and I’ve spoken to 10 different people, it’s not going to be like it was,” the president said, citing improved containment and mitigation efforts.
When pressed by reporters, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, did not directly support the president’s assertion. But Dr. Fauci, another leading scientific voice for the administration, supported Dr. Redfield’s assertion that the virus would be here in the fall.
“What Dr. Redfield was saying, first of all, is that we will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that,” he said, adding: “It’s going to be complicated. So whether or not it’s going to be big or small is going to depend on our response.”
The president has on multiple occasions suggested that the pandemic would ease off in the summer, despite research showing otherwise. Several small studies have indicated that while warmer temperatures might make it harder for the coronavirus to survive in the air or on surfaces for long periods of time, it could still be contagious for hours, if not days.
Cases have also continued to explode in countries with equatorial climates and those in the Southern Hemisphere, which is currently in the middle of autumn.

Health Dept. Official Says Doubts on Hydroxychloroquine Led to His Ouster,"Rick Bright was abruptly dismissed this week as the director of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
WASHINGTON — The official who led the federal agency involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine said on Wednesday that he was removed from his post after he pressed for rigorous vetting of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug embraced by President Trump as a coronavirus treatment, and that the administration had put “politics and cronyism ahead of science.”
Rick Bright was abruptly dismissed this week as the director of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and removed as the deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response. He was given a narrower job at the National Institutes of Health.
In a scorching statement, Dr. Bright, who received a Ph.D. in immunology and molecular pathogenesis from Emory University, assailed the leadership at the health department, saying he was pressured to direct money toward hydroxychloroquine, one of several “potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections” and repeatedly described by the president as a potential “game changer” in the fight against the virus.
“I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,” he said in his statement. “I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science — not politics or cronyism — has to lead the way.”
Doubts about the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus and the lack of evidence about the drug’s effectiveness — including some small studies that indicated patients could be harmed — appear to have dampened Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm for it.
As the seriousness of the pandemic became clearer in mid-March, the president seized on anecdotal reports about victims of the coronavirus who recovered quickly after using the drug. Desperate for good news as he watched the death toll climb and the stock market plummet, Mr. Trump could hardly contain his excitement.
In a post on Twitter on March 21, the president urged federal officials to quickly approve the use of hydroxychloroquine with an antibiotic called azithromycin — a combination that he believed could work on the coronavirus.
“Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents) be put in use IMMEDIATELY,” he tweeted. “PEOPLE ARE DYING, MOVE FAST, and GOD BLESS EVERYONE!”
By then, Mr. Trump’s favorite Fox News hosts were echoing his optimism that hydroxychloroquine could be a magic bullet against the virus. A day after meeting in the Oval Office with one of the hosts, Laura Ingraham, and two doctors promoting the drug as a cure-all, Mr. Trump became First Salesman, promoting it from the White House briefing room.
“I’ll say it again: What do you have to lose?” Mr. Trump said on April 4, carefully pronouncing hydroxychloroquine. His presidential prescription: “Take it.”
In briefing after briefing with reporters at the White House, Mr. Trump defied the voices of medical experts and some of his own top advisers — including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist and an adviser to the coronavirus task force. They cautioned that hydroxychloroquine, which is used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus as well as malaria, needed to undergo the same kind of rigorous evaluation that other drugs do.
At the end of March, a division of Novartis, a leading pharmaceutical company, donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to the health department’s stockpile for the possible use of treating Covid-19. Mr. Trump heralded the announcement a few days later, saying that the drug “may work, then again, it may not work.”
But in mid-April, a small drug trial in Brazil was halted after some patients developed irregular heart rates. Then a study this week of 368 V.A. patients, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it did not help patients avoid the need for ventilators, and that the use of the drug alone was associated with an increased risk of death. And , a panel of the government’s own experts at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said there was “insufficient data” to recommend taking it to treat symptoms from the virus.
The president has not talked much since then about hydroxychloroquine.
In his statement, Dr. Bright did not directly name Mr. Trump. But the searing language he used left little doubt that he viewed the administration’s support for the drug as pressure to ignore scientific facts in favor of politics.
“My professional background has prepared me for a moment like this — to confront and defeat a deadly virus that threatens Americans and people around the globe,” Dr. Bright wrote. “To this point, I have led the government’s efforts to invest in the best science available to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.”
“Unfortunately, this resulted in clashes with H.H.S. political leadership, including criticism for my proactive efforts to invest early into vaccines and supplies critical to saving American lives. I also resisted efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections,” he said, adding that hydroxychloroquine was “promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit.”
But Trump administration officials painted a different picture of Dr. Bright’s tenure.
Dr. Bright and Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response, clashed repeatedly, according to those officials. While Dr. Bright followed careful procedures, they said, he was a polarizing figure within the Department of Health and Human Services, where concerns had circulated about a management style that was described as confrontational.
Those officials said that there had been discussions about removing Dr. Bright for many months, and that they came to a head after emails were leaked to Reuters last week detailing internal discussions about chloroquines.
A senior administration official said that Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, told the coronavirus task force members in their meeting on Wednesday about Dr. Bright’s departure from BARDA, describing it as a promotion to the vice president. Officials left the meeting and learned of Dr. Bright’s public statement.
In a statement, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that “Dr. Bright has departed BARDA to N.I.H., where he’ll work on development and deployment of novel point-of-care testing platforms.”
She added: “As it relates to chloroquine, it was Dr. Bright who requested an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for donations of chloroquine that Bayer and Sandoz recently made to the Strategic National Stockpile for use on Covid-19 patients. The E.U.A. is what made the donated product available for use in combating Covid-19.”
Asked about Dr. Bright and his transfer on Wednesday at the daily White House briefing, Mr. Trump said he did not know who he was.
“I never heard of him,” the president told reporters. “You just mentioned the name, I never heard of him. When did this happen? I never heard of him. The guy says he was pushed out of a job. Maybe he was. Maybe he wasn’t; I’d have to hear the other side. I don’t know who he is.”
A career government official who has led BARDA since 2016, Dr. Bright pointed specifically to the initial efforts to make chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine widely available before it was scientifically tested for efficacy with the coronavirus.
“While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public,” Dr. Bright said. He went on to describe what he said ultimately happened: “I insisted that these drugs be provided only to hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 while under the supervision of a physician.”
A person familiar with Dr. Bright’s account said that Dr. Bright was pressured to rush access to the drug after the president and Larry Ellison, the chairman and chief technology officer of Oracle, had a conversation about chloroquines. Dr. Bright was then directed to put in place a nationwide expanded access program to make the drugs available on a broad basis without specific controls in place, according to the person familiar with his account.
Medical experts say that it is still not known  whether hydroxychloroquine might emerge as an effective treatment for the most devastating symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The studies in Brazil and at the Department of Veterans Affairs were small and limited. Comprehensive, peer-reviewed studies have yet to be completed, and while hospitals are using the drug, many doctors acknowledge they are doing so only because they have few other tools to help dying patients.
And inside the White House, the drug still has its true believers, including Peter Navarro, a trade adviser who has been put in charge of procuring protective gear and other medical supplies to fight the virus. Mr. Navarro is relentless with anyone in the West Wing who will listen, encouraging the government to keep stockpiling the drug and dismissing the recent studies as “deeply flawed.”
The Brazil study gave doses of hydroxychloroquine in excess of the levels recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, Mr. Navarro said in an interview. The veterans study administered the medicine too late and focused narrowly on an older population with high incidences of cardiac failure, diabetes and lung disease, among other issues, he insisted.
“None of this was reported by a mainstream media which appears incapable of reading anything more than study headlines,” he said. “To date, almost 40 studies have reported apparent usefulness of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in shortening length of hospital stay, improving symptoms, and resolving lung lesions as seen on X-rays.”
And some doctors around the country are still hopeful that more complete tests of the drug might still yield some positive news.
Dr. William W. O’Neill, a cardiologist at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit who is organizing a large randomized study using the drug as a preventive medication in health care workers and emergency medical workers, said he had “cautious optimism” but urged the public to avoid drawing premature conclusions.
“Everybody is desperate to find out all the answers,” Dr. O’Neill said. “But we have to be careful about jumping to conclusions either way.”
Dr. Bright said his superiors at the Department of Health and Human Services were doing exactly that.
Dr. Bright is represented by two lawyers who work with whistle-blowers, and who represented Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual misconduct decades ago, a claim he denied.
In a statement, they called Dr. Bright’s change in position “retaliation, plain and simple” and said they planned to ask for an investigation.",politicsNews,4/22/2020,New York Times
The Cold Calculations Governors Will Have to Make Before Reopening,"With no vaccine or cure, the president, governors, mayors and county executives will have to decide how many deaths would be acceptable to restore a shattered economy.
WASHINGTON — How many deaths are acceptable to reopen the country before the coronavirus is completely eradicated? “One is too many,” President Trump insists, a politically safe formulation that any leader would instinctively articulate.
But that is not the reality of Mr. Trump’s reopen-soon approach. Nor for that matter will it be the bottom line for even those governors who want to go slower. Until there is a vaccine or a cure for the coronavirus, the macabre truth is that any plan to begin restoring public life invariably means trading away some lives. The question is how far will leaders go to keep it to a minimum.
Some of the more provocative voices on the political right say that with tens of millions of Americans out of work and businesses collapsing, some people must be sacrificed for the greater good of restoring the economy quickly. To many, that sounds unthinkable, but less inflammatory experts and policymakers also acknowledge that there are enormous costs to keeping so much of the work force idle, with many of the unemployed struggling to pay for food, shelter or medical care for other health challenges.
And so the nation’s leaders are left with the excruciating dilemma of figuring out how to balance life and livelihood on a scale unseen in generations. “Every governor in the nation is asking that,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, where 2,700 have died and more than 1 million have lost jobs, said this week. “There’s no such thing as zero risk in the world in which we’re living. But we know that not taking measures to control the spread means that’s going to translate into lives lost.”
With no cure available for the coronavirus and no vaccine likely for another year or more, governors in hard-hit states are seeking ways to minimize the number of additional deaths by staging and structuring any reopening. Time and testing are key, according to public health experts. The longer a quarantine can be extended the better, they say, and the more testing made available, the easier it would be to properly calibrate a reopening and respond to any new outbreak.
Pushing to restore business sooner rather than later, Mr. Trump has dismissed waiting until comprehensive testing provides a better map of where the infection has spread. Instead, the federal government’s guidelines envision “sentinel surveillance” testing of vulnerable places like nursing homes and inner-city health centers, while gradually reopening businesses, schools and other venues in stages with precautions like masks, gloves and social distancing.
All of which could mitigate future infections but would not halt them. The reason the death toll projection may be closer to 60,000 rather than the 2 million of one estimate was because society largely shut down. One recent study said that the 60,000 deaths would have been 6,000 had quarantine measures been imposed just two weeks earlier. So easing measures means the death toll will go up even with safeguards.
But remaining closed is not without a cost either. In just four weeks, a staggering 22 million Americans have lost their jobs, the equivalent of the entire labor force of 23 states.
The question divides not only the nation but even families. Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago and White House chief of staff, and his brother, Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a prominent medical ethicist and vice provost of global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, have engaged in a running quarrel about how soon society should reopen.
Rahm Emanuel considers it untenable to keep most of the country closed until the virus is completely under control, while Ezekiel Emanuel maintains that the pandemic is too much of a threat to rush back to life as usual.
“There’s nothing you can do risk free. Nothing,” Rahm Emanuel said last week. “And the missing ingredient is what do you think the public can accept and what will you do to be forthright and honest?” The public, he said, understands that life comes with peril as long as measures are taken to minimize it. “If you reduce the speed limit dramatically, you’d have less deaths,” Mr. Emanuel said. “But we allow it to go to a certain level.”
In a separate call, Ezekiel Emanuel said: “I think Rahm is wrong on how bad it could be by letting it run around the population. I’m not for keeping the economy closed forever. Sometimes my brother paints me in a picture. But you have to do it safely. Safely doesn’t mean no deaths. I never said no Covid deaths. But you have to do it in a way that is measured, not irresponsible where you’re going to get to 2 million deaths.”
The trade-offs have stirred angry exchanges since the start of the lockdowns. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas, who is 70, said last month that older people like himself should be ready to risk death to save the economy for their grandchildren, comments he defended on Fox News on Monday night. In a separate appearance on Fox last week, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the television host, cited a study to argue that reopening schools “may only cost us 2 to 3 percent in terms of total mortality,” calling it “a trade-off some folks would consider.” After a backlash, he said he “misspoke” and expressed regret that he “confused and upset people.”
Some of those charged with making these decisions said far more information is required to reopen with enough confidence to constrain further spread of the virus and avoid a deadly second wave. Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said his state would need to double the number of tests.
“You have to crack the back of the personal health piece before you can crack the back of the economic piece,” he said this week. Noting that 177 people in his state died the day before, he added: “The house is still on fire and the fire brigade is still out there trying to put the fire out.”
The situation, not surprisingly, looks different in different parts of the country. The trade-offs in Wyoming, where there have been six deaths, or in Hawaii, with 12 deaths, hardly compare to those in New Jersey, where more than 5,000 have died, or in New York, where more than 15,000 have died.
The United States has always tolerated a certain amount of preventable death. To use Rahm Emanuel’s example, Americans reduce traffic fatalities by requiring seatbelts and airbags, imposing speed limits and employing police. But until better technology is perfected, the only way to actually stop all car crashes — banning cars — is untenable, so some deaths are countenanced, a total of 38,800 in 2019.
Auto accidents are not communicable so not an apples-to-apples comparison to the coronavirus. But the ordinary flu still claims thousands of lives a year — anywhere from 12,000 in the 2011-12 season up to an estimated 61,000 in 2017-18 — which society accepts without stay-at-home orders. Those seasonal deaths, however, are spread over many months, while the coronavirus hit with catastrophic fury in a matter of weeks and would have caused even more devastation without the quarantines.
Government makes money-versus-lives trade-offs all the time. When a regulatory agency weighs a new safety rule, it measures the cost to industry or consumers against the gain by assigning a dollar value to each life that might be saved. If a new rule costs billions of dollars but would only prevent a few dozen deaths, it likely would not be adopted — even though someone would die as a result.
The idea that the government translates life to dollars and cents may sound bloodless but it is not unusual. A White House report from 2017, for instance, estimated the cost of 41,000 deaths attributed to opioid overdoses in 2015 at $431.7 billion, an average of $10.5 million per person.
By that calculation, the 60,000 deaths projected from the coronavirus would be valued at $631.8 billion — while the roughly 2 million lives theoretically saved by lockdowns would be worth about $21 trillion, or nearly eight times the $2.7 trillion in relief spending brokered by Congress and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
But James H. Stock, a Harvard economist who served on President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, said this crisis goes beyond such ordinary calculations because a shuttered economy represents an almost existential threat to the very idea of America.
“We really have to be talking not just about our reduction in consumption in the short run but what this is going to be doing to the economy and the republic in the long run,” he said. “It’s those big issues that we’ve been afraid to talk about. A year of this and we would just see an unrecognizable transformation of what America would look like coming out of it.”
Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who serves on Mr. Trump’s reopening committee, said those advocating restarting the economy are caricatured as putting profits over lives.
“I reject this idea that the people who are for keeping the economy shut down are the angels because they’re the ones who care about human life,” said Mr. Moore, who has coordinated with lockdown protesters. “What about the poverty? What about the suicides? What about the child abuse cases and the alcoholism and the drug overdoses and the depression and all of the negative effects to health and well-being that are associated with an economy in recession?”
Studies show that depression, drug use and suicides spike during economic hardship, including after the last recession, and the all-consuming focus of the medical system on the coronavirus in certain areas has delayed other medical care. Yet that might be offset by falling violent crime, car crashes, workplace accidents and air pollution. Vehicle collisions in California decreased by half after its stay-at-home order went into effect while murder and air pollution are each down 25 percent in New York City.
Some scholars argue that reopening too quickly would actually hurt the economy, particularly if it resulted in a second wave that destroyed public confidence. A study of the 1918 influenza pandemic found that cities that closed schools and banned public gatherings earlier and kept them shut longer not only had fewer deaths but emerged better economically.
Governor Murphy said resuming public life would not succeed if people did not feel certain that the virus had been contained. Indeed, 76 percent of Americans said social distancing should continue as long as needed to curb the virus even if it meant continued damage to the economy, according to a new poll by Politico and Morning Consult, while just 14 percent favored an end to restrictions to stimulate the economy even if it meant spreading the virus.
“If you opened every restaurant in New Jersey tomorrow, I don’t think anybody would show up,” Governor Murphy said. “It’s not like we’re holding back some pent-up demand. I don’t blame them — there are folks out there who are frustrated, who have cabin fever, who want to break free. So do I, by the way. But I think folks also want to have confidence that they’re not going to get sick and die.”",politicsNews,4/22/2020,New York Times
Tight-Knit Company Towns Reel as Coronavirus Rolls Through,"Cases are leveling off in some coastal cities, but outbreaks are mounting in processing plants and factories in Midwestern towns.
As soon as she heard about a cluster of coronavirus cases at the Tyson pork processing plant on the edge of Columbus Junction, Iowa, Cindy Johnston felt a ripple effect through her small community along the Iowa River.
Ms. Johnston, who manages a Dairy Sweet burgers and ice cream shack, sent home four teenage employees because their parents work at the Tyson plant. Parents of other teenage workers were too afraid of potential infection to let their children report to work at Dairy Sweet. Then, she learned of the death of an employee at the Tyson plant; it was the father of a classmate of her son.
“I’ve lived in this community all my life, and I’ve never seen it so scared,” said Ms. Johnston, who is 52, nearly the same age as the father who died.
Across the country, some big cities on the coasts are starting to experience a leveling off of Covid-19 cases, but a staggering number of small Midwestern towns anchored by meatpacking plants and other factories are finding themselves as new hot spots of the virus.
The new cases are worrying because they come as many officials are contemplating reopening the nation’s businesses. The outbreaks now are raising the prospect of new spread in less populous communities in the middle of the country and complicating these company towns’ debates over when to restart public life.
Tyson Foods closed the plant in Columbus Junction earlier this month. The company announced Wednesday it was closing a plant in Logansport, Ind., as well as a large pork processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa, after calls from public officials to shutter the facility amid a growing outbreak.A Smithfield meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., has nearly 1,000 cases tied to its facility. And a JBS pork plant in Worthington, Minn., a Hormel food processing facility in Rochelle, Ill., and a ConAgra food processing plant in Marshall, Mo., are among others that have reported significant outbreaks.
Infections can spread fast in the facilities as employees work side by side and gather in cafeterias or locker rooms. In many rural Midwestern areas, these businesses are often the only large workplaces for miles around.
The new outbreaks have an outsize impact on families, congregations and, in particular, other businesses in communities that are trying to think about reopening as some political leaders in state capitals and in Washington call for the beginnings of a return to economic normalcy.
“It’s going to be a new normal for us,” said Michael Schepp, owner of Helix Wine and Bites, a restaurant in Grand Forks, N.D., where public health officials have traced at least 128 positive cases of the virus to a wind power plant.
Earlier this week, the plant, called LM Wind Power, which is owned by G.E., closed for what it said would be at least two weeks so it could be disinfected. Along with a university and a hospital system, the plant is one of the biggest employers in Grand Forks.
The outbreak was another blow for business owners like Mr. Schepp, who had been scrambling to figure out how the restaurant could reopen its dining room.
“As a city we were in really good shape leading up to that, but it shows you how quickly this thing can change,” he said.
Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, a Republican, has called for a reopening of the economy on May 1. Mr. Schepp hopes that by then he can allow a limited number of patrons in his dining room. But he said he is not sure exactly how that would work. In the meantime, he has been serving wine by the glass and cocktails to-go.
“We’re going to have to reinvent the restaurant industry,” he said.
In Madison, Neb., residents are bracing for a broader spread of the virus after six cases were reported at a Tyson plant on Sunday.
The plant is the biggest workplace around, with Madison residents and commuters among its employees. Some local businesses such as Burrito King, a beloved restaurant, have closed completely. In the community of about 2,400 residents, volunteers have donated floral bouquets and cupcakes to nursing home residents who no longer can receive visitors because of the virus threat, and the fire department has offered to drive by, sirens blaring, the homes of children celebrating birthdays.
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, who has declined to issue a blanket stay-at-home order, has called for a gradual reopening of the economy starting next month. But Madison is planning to take things extra slowly, Al Brandl, the mayor, said.
“We want to just get through this,” he said.
In Columbus Junction, practically everyone in the community of 2,000 residents works at the Tyson plant or knows someone who does. And now, after the outbreak at the plant earlier this month, nearly everyone knows someone who has the virus. Almost 150 workers among the plant’s 1,400 employees have tested positive for the virus. Two employees have died.
The plant looms large over the town, its tentacles reaching a church where sickened employees are among congregants and now in need of prayers and grocery deliveries, and a day care facility that already had seen its numbers shrink and decided to send home children whose parents worked at the plant.
It affected the clients of the veterinary practice of Mike Todd who passes by the Tyson plant on his way to farms to treat large animals, a part of his business he still operates because he can maintain social distancing easily in a barn or pasture.
Mr. Todd is slowly trying to reopen his Louisa Veterinary Clinic. He’s vaccinating puppies to prevent illness. And on Tuesday, he removed a tumor from a dog. He plans to allow for more elective procedures in the days to come.
“We’re just being careful,” he said. “Everything is a risk to some extent.”
On Main Street in Columbus Junction, Five Star Grocery is still open, but Joseph Hu, the owner, is allowing just two people inside at a time. His small store caters to fellow Burmese immigrants who moved to the town to work at the pork plant.
“Now that the virus is here, nobody is shopping,” Mr. Hu said. “A lot of people are scared.”
Across the country, everyone is looking ahead to reopening the economy. Mr. Hu is no different, even though the possibility seems tenuous in the small community that is in the midst of managing such a large outbreak.
The Tyson plant had shut down on April 6, and Mr. Hu said that his optimism was bolstered after he learned that the plant partially reopened this week. Company officials said that the facility had been disinfected and that they were checking employees’ temperatures, installing workstation dividers and requiring face coverings for workers.
Sick employees will be better soon, Mr. Hu predicted, and then they will start shopping again.
The owners of Dairy Sweet, a part-year operation that is about two miles from the Tyson plant, opened two weeks ahead of its usual seasonal schedule after realizing business at their other restaurant, the 92 Roadhouse Bar and Grill, was too scarce to keep it open for carryout, said Ms. Johnston, the Dairy Sweet manager.
Ms. Johnston said she sensed that the community was starting to feel a bit more at ease in recent days. Ms. Johnston has “adopted” a high school senior, a volunteer project to send small gifts to students whose final high school year has been cut short. She offered on Facebook to buy groceries for anyone in need. So far, she has had no takers.
Ms. Johnston is trying to stay healthy. She is downing extra vitamin C and elderberry supplements. Her hands are chapped from washing them so much.
At Dairy Sweet, employees are wearing masks and gloves. They rub credit cards with Clorox wipes before and after handling them. Other than that, the business hasn’t changed much since it first opened in 1956.
It never had a dining room; customers place orders at a pickup window or a drive-through. In that way, Dairy Sweet is one of the few places in town that feels normal. Most days, in fact, business is way up, double its usual, she said.",politicsNews,4/22/2020,New York Times
